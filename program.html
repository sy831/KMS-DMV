         <abstract>
         The notion of nonlocal mean curvature was introduced around 10 years ago and arises in variational problems for the fractional perimeter and related nonlocal interfacial energies. I will first review this notion and discuss its main properties in comparison with classical mean curvature. The main part of the talk will then focus on the class of hypersurfaces with constant nonlocal mean curvature. Although this class is still largely unexplored, first results show both similarities and striking differences to the classical local setting of constant mean curvature surfaces.

         In 1968, Hirzebruch defined a signature defect invariant of manifolds over the group of order two, which was later generalized by many authors including Atiyah, Patodi, Singer, Wall, Cheeger and Gromov. I will discuss some recent advances in low dimensional topology, in which Hirzebruch-type $L^2$-signature defects play an essential role. These will include the disk embedding problem in dimension 4, for topological and smooth cases, and quantitative topology of 3-manifolds.

         Barry Mazur's celebrated 1977 article ``Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal&quot; centers on the simplest modular curve, $X_0(N)$, where $N$ is a prime number. In Mazur's situation, the Eisenstein ideal has at least a half-dozen equivalent definitions because the ideal is the precise annihilator of a handful of physical objects attached to the modular curve. In more general situations, mimicking the definitions in the prime-level case would lead to a collection of disparate ideals, and one can see easily in examples. Nevertheless, there is a natural candidate for ``Eisenstein ideal&quot; that is contained in all the other candidates. We show that this candidate is very close to being the exact annihilator of the cuspidal subgroup that was studied by Kubert and Lang in the 1970s and 1980s. This is joint work with B. Jordan and A. Scholl.

         We present a brief survey on the theory of metric measure spaces with synthetic lower Ricci bounds, initiated by the author and by Lott/Villani, and developed further by Ambrosio/Gigli/Savare and by many others. Particular emphasis will be given to recent breakthroughs concerning the local structure of RCD-spaces by Mondino/Naber and by Brue/Semola and to rigidity results. For instance, given an arbitrary RCD(N-1,N)-space $(X,d,m)$, then $$\int\int \cos d(x,y)\, dm(x)\, dm(y)\le0$$
if and only if N is an integer and $(X,d,m)$ is isomorphic to the N-dimensional round sphere.
Moreover, we study the heat equation on time-dependent metric measure spaces and its dual as gradient flows for the energy and for the Boltzmann entropy, resp. Monotonicity estimates for transportation distances and for squared gradients will be shown to be equivalent to the so-called dynamical convexity of the Boltzmann entropy on the Wasserstein space which is the defining property of super-Ricci flows. Moreover, we show the equivalence with the monotone coupling property for pairs of backward Brownian motions as well as with log Sobolev, local Poincar\'e and dimension free Harnack inequalities.

         Percy Deift has conjectured that solutions to the KdV equation with almost periodic initial data exist globally and are almost periodic in time. This talk will present the history and context of the problem, and explain recent work related to the Deift conjecture, especially in cases where the initial data in question are reflectionless. Within this class of initial data, the conjecture has been confirmed under suitable additional assumptions, but the resulting setup that establishes almost periodicity in time also suggests which mechanisms may be responsible for the potential existence of counterexamples.

         In 1979, J. J. Kohn invented a purely algebraic construction of ideals of subelliptic multipliers for the $\bar\partial$-Neumann problem. But Kohn's original procedure gives no effective bound on the order of subellipticity in subelliptic estimates. In 2010, Y.-T. Siu obtained a new effective procedure to terminate Kohn's algorithm for so-called special domains and outlined an extension of the special domain approach to general real-analytic and smooth cases. In this talk, we explain effective algorithm for multipliers and its difference with the full-real-radical Kohn algorithm. Then we propose a new class of geometric invariants, called jet vanishing orders, that permits us to obtain a new control of the effectiveness in the Kohn's construction procedure of subelliptic multipliers for the special domains of finite D'Angelo type in $\mathbb{C}^3$. We also present a triangular system of multipliers for special domain in arbitrary dimension. This is a joint project with D. Zaitsev.

         We live in an uncertain world, and face massive data everyday. Conspiracy theories are abound and propagate with the aid of SNS. There must be a way of navigating the torrent waves of big data!
Mathematics plays a key role in dealing with the uncertainly and the massiveness. It provides ways of telling significant information from insignificant one (the concept of entropy). Topology, a branch of mathematics, allows us to look at the shape of data in order to gain valuable insights about the nature of data.

         Symmetric structures are literally everywhere:
Nature produces (almost) symmetrical patterns.
Artefacts of cultures all over the world make use of repetitive patterns.
And in science symmetry can be found as an ordering principle.
Visual symmetric patterns (Ornaments) are full of amazing structures and surprising twists. The talk gives a mathematical view on the topic of visual symmetry starting from simple kaleidoscopic patterns via intricate circle limits a la M. C. Escher to complex non-Euclidean spaces. It shows the ups and downs the challenges and successes of the creation of software that allows a playful approach to this fascinating topic. The talk includes many interactive visual software demonstrations with state of the art software on tablets and computers and shows how virtual creations can turn into real world objects. It also gives insights into the vivid interplay of serious mathematics and playful art as well as playful mathematics and serious art.

Using previous results about Killing tensors on negatively curved manifolds and a new characterization of SU(3)-structures in dimension 6 whose associated 3-form is Killing, I will show
that every Killing 3-form on a compact $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold with negative sectional curvature vanishes if $n\ge 4$. The talk is based on a joint work with Laura Barberis and Andrei Moroianu.

         The images of the Gauss map (Gauss images) of isoparametric hypersurfaces in the standard sphere
provide a nice class of compact minimal (thus monotone) Lagrangian submanifolds embedded in a complex hyperquadrics which is a compact Hermitian symmetric space of rank 2. It is an interesting problem to study the properties of such Lagrangian submanifolds by the well-developed theory of isoparametric hypersurfaces. In this talk I will give a survey of our recent works and environs on Hamiltonian stability problem, Hamiltonian non-displaceability and Floer homology of such Lagrangian submanifolds. I will also mention about some related open problems and conjectures.

         A subset $S$ of a compact Riemannian symmetric space is called an antipodal set if it satisfies $s_x(y)=y$ for any $x, y$ in $S$, where $s_x$ denotes the geodesic symmetry at $x$. An antipodal set is finite. It is known that the intersection of two real forms in a Hermitian symmetric space of compact type is an antipodal set if they intersect transversely. A maximal antipodal set of a symmetric $R$-space is unique up to congruence and it is an orbit of some Weyl group. A maximal antipodal set of a compact Lie group which contains the identity element is a subgroup, which is isomorphic to an abelian group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. We classified maximal antipodal subgroups of the quotient groups of some classical compact Lie groups by giving explicit description of representative of each conjugate class. In this talk I will explain the classification of maximal antipodal sets of some compact Riemmanian symmetric spaces of classical type and their quotient spaces. We use nice embeddings of these symmetric spaces into compact Lie groups and our former results. This talk is based on a joint work with Hiroyuki Tasaki.

         H.~Anciaux and K.~Panagiotidou obtained the very basic results for real hypersurfaces in the indefinite complex projective space ${\mathbb C}P^n$ of index $1\leq p\leq n-1$. (See H. Anciaux, K. Panagiotidou, \emph{Hopf Hypersurfaces in pseudo-Riemannian complex and para-complex space forms}, Diff. Geom. Appl. \textbf{42} (2015), 1--14).

We wish to further develop their ideas. We re-obtain the almost contact metric structure on a real hypersurface in ${\mathbb C}P^n$, namely $(g,\phi,\xi,\eta)$. We construct new examples, which we call \textit{real hypersurfaces of type $A_+$, $A_-$, $B_0$, $B_+$, $B_-$ and $C$}, because they are somehow similar to those in the famous Takagi's and Montiel's lists. All our examples are Hopf. We also exhibit an example of a lightlike Hopf real hypersurface. We prove that two real hypersurfaces with the same shape operator are linked by a holomorphic isometry of the ambient space. Next, we classify the non-degenerate real hypersurfaces in indefinite complex projective space such that $AX=\lambda X+\rho \eta(X)\xi$, where $\lambda$ and $\rho$ are smooth functions. Finally, we classify those non-degenerate real hypersurfaces such that $A\phi=\phi A$.

         The concept of a Riemannian orbifold generalises the one of a Riemannian manifold by permitting certain singularities. In particular, one is able to speak about several concepts known from classical Riemannian geometry including geodesics. Whenever all geodesics can be extended for infinite time and are all periodic, the orbifold is called a \emph{Besse orbifold}---in analogy to Besse manifolds. A classical result in the simply-connected manifold case states that in odd dimensions only spheres may arise as examples of Besse manifolds.

In this talk we shall illustrate that the same holds for Besse orbifolds, namely that they are actually already manifolds whence they are spheres. The talk is based on joint work in progress with Christian Lange and Marco Radeschi.

         In this talk, we give the definition of generalized $s$-manifolds as a generalization of symmetric spaces. For a generalized $s$-manifolds, we introduce the notions of polar and antipodal set, and define a geometric invariant, which we call the antipodal number, as the supremum of cardinalities of antipodal sets. We show that a flag manifold consisting of sequences of subspaces with inclusion relations in a vector space admits structures of generalized $s$-manifolds, and determine maximal antipodal sets and the antipodal number. We mention that the antipodal number of the flag manifold is related to its topology.

         On a real hypersurface $M$ in a non-flat complex space form we can consider two types of connections: the Levi-Civita connection, which is a torsion free connection, and, for any nonnull constant $k$, the $k$-th generalized Tanaka-Webter connection, which is affine connection with torsion. Therefore, we have the associated covariant derivatives. Moreover on $M$ we also have the Lie derivative and a derivative of Lie type associated to the $k$-th generalized Tanaka-Webster connection. We classify real hypersurfaces in non-flat complex space forms for which either both covariant derivatives or Lie derivative and the derivative of Lie type associated to the $k$-th generalized Tanaka-Webster connection coincide when they act on the operator $\phi A-A\phi$, where $\phi$ denotes the structure operator and $A$ the shape operator of $M$, either in the direction of the structure vector field $\xi$ or in any direction of the maximal holomorphic distribution on $M$.

         Symmetric spaces are a central class of examples in Riemannian geometry and it has often been a fruitful approach to study to what extent certain properties of symmetric spaces continue to hold for more general classes of Riemannian manifolds. In this talk, I will speak about the question whether a well-known property of Riemannian symmetric spaces, namely the polarity of their isotropy actions, holds for more general types of homogeneous manifolds. I will present various results on homogeneous spaces with polar isotropy.

         We obtain novel results concerning the deformation theory of twistor spaces of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. Specifically we show that the local deformations of such twistor spaces are unobstructed. The proof is based upon an extension theorem for families of irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds. This theorem compensates for the fact that, generally, fine moduli spaces of marked irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds do not exist.

         Cubic threefolds were the first class of varieties who were shown to be unirational but not rational (Clemens, Griffiths). The key tool of the proof is the intermediate Jacobian, a principally polarized abelian variety of dimension 5. There is a second link to Hodge theory, namely via cubic fourfolds (Allcock, Carlson, Toledo) which leads to a $10$-dimensional ball quotient model. Looking at cubic threefolds from these different points of view leads to various geometrically relevant compactifications of the moduli space of cubic threefolds. In this talk I will discuss the geometry and the topology of these spaces. This is joint work with S. Casalaina-Martin, S. Grushevsky and R. Laza.

         The Beauville-Bogomolov decomposition of smooth projective manifolds is a cornerstone of the classification of higher-dimensional varieties. For varieties with mild singularities (e.g. minimal models) the analytic tools used in the proof are not available, so one has to look for a different strategy. In this talk I will explain how foliation theory enters the picture. A positivity result for reflexive sheaves then allows to extend the decomposition theorem to the singular setting. This is joint work with Thomas Peternell.

         The B-Semiampleness Conjecture of Prokhorov and Shokurov predicts that the moduli part in a canonical bundle formula is semiample on a birational modification. We prove that the restriction of the moduli part to any sufficiently high divisorial valuation is semiample, assuming the conjecture in lower dimensions. This is joint work with Enrica Floris.

         It is a well-known fact that every automorphism of a smooth hypersurface $S$ of degree $d$ in $\mathbb{P}^n$, $n\geq 2$, comes from the automorphism group of $\mathbb{P}^n$ unless $(n,d)= (2,3), (3,4)$. In my talk, I reinvestigate this phenomenon inside out, i.e., the problem when the automorphism group of the complement of the hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^n$ coincides with the subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathbb{P}^n$ that keeps the hypersurface $S$ fixed.

         When considering the action of a finite group $G$ on a complex vector space $V$, polarization is an important concept in invariant theory. It allows to produce polynomial invariants of $V^n \oplus (V^*)^m$ out of polynomial invariants of $V$. We discuss this question for $n=1=m$. This is joint work in progress with M. Bulois, M. Lehn, and R. Terpereau.

         In this talk we study the degree the canonical map of surfaces isogenous to a product.
According to A. Beauville, the degree of the canonical map of a surface $S$ of general type is at most 36.
The maximum can only be achieved if $S$ is a ball quotient, $|K_S|$ is base point free, $p_g(S)=3$ and $q(S)=0$.
We prove that the highest degree of a regular surface $S$ isogenous to a product, that is obtained by the action of an abelian group is $32$. This value is realized by precisely two families with $p_g(S)=3$ and $q(S)=0$.
Moreover we give an example of a surface $S$ isogenous to a product with $p_g(S)=3, q(S)=1$ such that
the degree of the canonical map is $24$. This is joint work with Carlos Rito and Roberto Pignatelli.

         Let $M^\circ$ be the space of twisted ideal sheaves $\mathcal{I}_{L,Q}(1)$ where $Q$ is a rank $4$ quardric hypersurface in $\mathbb{P}^r$ and $L$ is a linear subspace of dimension $r-2$. The Simpson compactification $\mathbf{M}$ of $M^\circ$ has been studied in different view points: The homological mirror symmetry and the log minimal model program. In the second perspective, the first named author (in other work with H.-B. Moon) proved that Kirwan's partial desingularization of $\mathbf{M}$ is isomorphic to the moduli space of degree $2$ stable maps in Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}(r-1,r+1)$. In this talk, by applying Kirwan's method, we obtain the intersection Hodge-Deligne (IHD) polynomial of $\mathbf{M}$. As a direct consequence, we obtain the IHD-polynomial of the moduli space of pure sheaves on the total space of the canonical line bundle of del-Pezzo surfaces. We also calculate the IHD-polynomial of some open cones which naturally comes from the microlocal geometric structure of $\mathbf{M}$.

         We detect rational homology balls embedded in smooth $4$-manifolds via the minimal model program for $3$-dimensional complex algebraic varieties. We show that there are (infinitely many) pairs of disjoint rational homology balls $B_{p,q}$ smoothly embedded (i) in regular neighborhoods of (almost all) linear chains of $2$-spheres with negative self-intersections, (ii) in blown-up rational homology balls $B_{n,a} \sharp \overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$, and (iii) in the Milnor fibers of certain cyclic quotient surface singularities. Furthermore, we show that every embedding of a rational homology in a regular neighborhood of negative $2$-spheres can be derived from the minimal model program if the corresponding rational blow-up of the rational homology ball may be obtained from the regular neighborhood just by a sequence of ordinary blow-ups. This is a joint work with Heesang Park and Giancarlo Urzúa.

         A K3 surface defienc over a field of positive characteristic is supersingular if the height of the formal Brauer group is the infinite. This condition is equivalent to that the rank of the Neron-Severi group of a K3 surface is 22. When the base characteristic is not equal to 3, it is also equivalent to that a K3 surface is unirational. In this talk, we will see that, when $k$ is an algebraically closed field of odd characteristic $p$ (possibly except $p=5$), every supersingular K3 surface over $k$ is isomorphic to a smooth quartic surface in $\mathbb{P}_{k}^{P3}$.

         There have been numerous attempts to classify log del Pezzo surfaces. To achieve this goal, we proposed an approach by using the concept of a `cascade', which can be viewed as a generalization of the classification of the smooth del Pezzo surfaces. So far this approach has been reasonably successful in the case when the log del Pezzo surface is toric or is of Picard number one. In this talk, I will focus on the toric case and explain the concept of cascades and how it leads to the classification, and possible applications.

         Severi established in 1902 the double point formula for the number of improper double points
of a variety X of dimension equal to the codimension. This was done in terms of projective invariants, called ceti.

The modern version is given (in Hartshorne's book without reference to Severi) in terms
of the Chern classes of the tangent bundle of the normalization of X and of the hyperplane divisor.

The main motivation for looking for generalizations is the following theorem, obtained with
Keiji Oguiso (the result when X is smooth was obtained in my AMS 1995 Santa Cruz article):

If a surface has geometric genus 5 and its canonical map is an embedding of the canonical model X,
then X is a complete intersection of type (2,4) or (3,3).

After explaining the classical and modern versions of the double point formulae, as given by Fulton and Laksov, and the relation between them,
I shall present several generalizations, some over the complex numbers, some char free.

I shall moreover briefly overview recent results concerning canonical surfaces in projective spaces of dimension 4 and 5.

I shall then illustrate more general embedding obstructions derived from the double point formula,
and shall deal with the problem of canonical embeddings of ample hypersurfaces
in Abelian varieties.

         We introduce a notion of $\mu$-structures which are certain locally compact group actions and prove some counterparts of results on Polish structures introduced by Krupinski. Using the Haar measure of locally compact groups, we introduce an independence, called $\mu$-independence, in $\mu$-structures having good properties. With this independence notion, we develop geometric stability theory for $\mu$-structures. Then we see some structural theorems for compact groups which are $\mu$-structure. We also give examples of profinite structures where $\mu$-independence is different from $nm$-independence introduced by Krupinski for Polish structures.

         Mekler has developed a way of interpreting any structure as a pure group. These groups are nilpotent of class 2 and of exponent $p&gt;2$. It is known that this construction preserves various model-theoretic properties, such as stability, simplicity, and NTP$_2$ so that it gives us certain pure group examples. In this talk, I will introduce the Mekler construction, and briefly show the main result that this construction also preserves NTP$_1$.

         Wilkie's theorem tells us that Peano arithmetic (PA) is the minimal first-order theory captured by the schematisation of the restricted second-order categorical axiomatisation of the standard model $\mathbb{N}$ over some finite first-order theory -- that is, the first-order schematisation Scheme$(\Phi)$ of the second order axiom $\forall X \Phi(X)$ is such that Scheme$(\Phi) \vdash_{FOL} PA$. But it fails to provide us with a maximal first-order theory, which suggests that external categoricity of arithmetic is not enough to present us with the corresponding unique first-order theory. The situation is different when internal categoricity is involved -- we say that a second-order theory $T^2$ is internally categorical if, in second-order logic with arithmetical language, it is deducible that all models of $T^2$ are isomorphic to one another -- that is $$\vdash_{SOL} \big(\forall M^2, N^2 \models T^2\ (M^2 \cong N^2) \big).$$ We will prove that the first-order theory captured by an internally categorical theory is exactly the theorems of second-order PA in the first-order language of arithmetic.

         While model checking, i.e., the algorithmic problem of checking
whether a given formula is true in a given finite structure, is
easily seen to be PSPACE complete in most interesting settings
and remains hard when parameterized by the input formula,
efficient algorithms have been found for restricted classes of
structures such as planar graphs. Since model checking provides a
unified approach to various algorithmic problems, such results
are often referred to as algorithmic meta-theorems.

We will review known algorithmic meta-theorems, which have
focussed on /sparse/ structure, in a sense that has only recently
been made precise. We will then see why current techniques are
unlikely to produce results for non-sparse structures and
investigate possible techniques for breaking this barrier.

         It is well-known that ZFC has long been a firm foundation for modern mathematics. However, due to its limits such as the undecidability of the continuum hypothesis, several mathematicians and logicians have thought up possible supplementations for ZFC or have created alternative foundations (such as NBG, Leśniewski's mereology, etc.) to it. In this talk I will present my trial of combining concepts from set theory, type theory, and Leśniewski's mereology to suggest a possible alternative to ZFC and show how mathematical concepts such as binary relations, functions, $\mathbb{N}$, $\mathbb{Z}$, $\mathbb{Q}$, $\mathbb{R}$, and $\mathbb{C}$ can be defined. Although my trial contained contradictions and thus failed, I would like to emphasize that adding the concept of parthood from mereology could be a possible supplementation for current set theories.

         First order G\&quot;odel logics form a well established class of many-valued logics with good proof-theoretic properties and extensive theory.

Quantified Propositional G\&quot;odel Logics have been studied only a few times, and not much is known about these logics besides a few results for specific logics. Propositional quantifiers allow for quantification of propositions, which in the setting of G\&quot;odel logics boils down to quantification over all truth values of the underlying truth-value set. Thus, they are somewhere between first order and second order quantifiers.

It has already been shown that there are uncountably many quantified propositional G\&quot;odel logics (without first order quantifiers), which is in stark contrast to the fact that there are only countably many first order G\&quot;odel logics.

For three cases, namely $V_\infty=[0,1]$, $V_\downarrow = \{0\}\cup\{1/n\mathrel{:} n&gt;0\}$,
and $V_\uparrow = \{1\}\cup\{1-1/n\mathrel{:} n&gt;0\}$, quantifier elimination has been shown for the propositional quantified G\&quot;odel logics, in later two cases by extension of the language with an additional operator.

In this talk we report on our research program to study the combination of propositional and first-order quantifieres with respect to G\&quot;odel logics.

         Previous work with U. Berger, K. Miyamoto and H. Tsuiki is extended in two
directions. (1) Instead of viewing the real numbers as abstractly
given objects with all the necessary properties assumed as axioms we
now use concrete real numbers (Cauchy sequences with moduli) and
provide formal proofs in the style of constructive analysis
(Bishop 67). Apart from being more complete, this resolves the
delicate issue which equality (for reals) is to be used in the
clauses of coinductively defined predicates. However, the choice of
our model for the reals does not influence the extracted (signed
digit or Gray code based) algorithms, since quantifiers over real
numbers are taken as non-computational. (2) Using ideas from
Ciaffaglione and Gianantonio, we extract signed digit and Gray
code based algorithms for division from a proof that the reals are
closed under division.

         We prove that the Weihrauch lattice can be transformed into a Brouwer algebra by the consecutive application of two closure operators in the appropriate order: first completion and then parallelization. The closure operator of completion is a new closure operator that we introduce. It transforms any problem into a total problem on the completion of the respective types, where we allow any value outside of the original domain of the problem. This closure operator is of interest by itself, as it generates a total version of Weihrauch reducibility that is defined like the usual version of Weihrauch reducibility, but in terms of total realizers. From a logical perspective completion can be seen as a way to make problems independent of their premises. Alongside with the completion operator and total Weihrauch reducibility we need to study precomplete representations hat are required to describe these concepts. In order to show that the parallelized completed Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra, we introduce a new multiplicative version of an implication.
While the parallelized completed Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra with this implication,
the completed Weihrauch lattice fails to be a model of intuitionistic linear logic in two different ways. In order to pinpoint the algebraic reasons for this failure, we introduce the concept of a Weihrauch algebra that allows us to formulate the failure in precise and neat terms.

         Formal Methods, the use of mathematical techniques for the specification, development and verification of software, have been explored by researchers since the 60ies, as a way to improve software quality. But their application in the software industry has been relatively rare. The reasons for this include perceived complexity of the tools and high cost of their use. In the last decade however, tools have become better, and the software challenges in the industry larger, so that the cost-benefit argument has changed. Large companies are applying formal methods every day to find bugs in their software, or even to prove the absence of bugs.
In this talk, we will give an overview over the history of formal methods in the software industry, the changes in the industry that motivate their increased use, and showcase the recent progress and applications of formal methods in the development of software.

         The Selberg zeta function $Z$ of a hyperbolic surface $X$ is a generating function for the geodesic length spectrum of $X$. It is a deep and influential result that the zeros of $Z$ encode the $L^2$-eigenvalues and resonances of the Laplacian of $X$, thereby showing e.g. an intimate relation between the geometric and spectral properties of the surface $X$. We report on the current status of a project to generalize these results to Selberg zeta function that are twisted by certain non-unitary representations. This is joint work with Ksenia Fedosova.

The proof uses standard methods involving Odlyzko bounds, as well as the proof of Serre's modularity conjecture. To the best of the author's knowledge, this is the first example of a number field K for which etale fundamental group of the spectrum of the ring of integers of K is finite, nonabelian and simple under the assumption of the GRH.

         The classification of discrete series is one important subject with numerous application in the harmonic analysis and in the theory of automorphic forms. We explain the result on the classification of discrete series of odd general spin groups, generalizing the M\oe glin-Tadi\'c classification for classical groups. If time permits, I will explain how our approach can be generalized to special cases of other connected reductive groups. This is the joint project with Ivan Mati\'c.

         Let $J_0(N)$ be the Jacobian variety of the modular curve $X_0(N)$. Let $C(N)$ be the cuspidal group of $J_0(N)$. As Ohta studied, the odd part of $C(N)$ is decomposed into eigenspaces of Atkin-Lehner involutions when $N$ is squarefree. In this talk, we explicitly describe generators of these eigenspaces and compute the precise orders of them. More generally, for a squarefree integer $N$ we compute the precise order of the image in $J_0(N)$ of any degree-0 cuspidal divisor on $X_0(N)$.

         We introduce equivariant wrapped Floer homology using an anti-symplectic involution, which is useful to study symmetric periodic Reeb orbits. With careful analysis on index iterations, we give the minimal number of geometrically distinct symmetric periodic Reeb orbits on real contact manifolds. The most interesting examples are star-shaped hypersurfaces in the complex plane with a natural involution, namely, the complex conjugate. This is joint work with Seongchan Kim and Myeonggi Kwon.

         A global surface of section in a 3-manifold with a flow is an embedded surface with the property that, except for the boundary of the surface, every orbit of the flow intersects the surface both in future and past time. This notion was developed by Poincar\'e and Birkhoff and can be used to simplify the dynamics: instead of flows one can study diffeomorphisms of surfaces.
We will survey some existence results of global surfaces of section before proceeding to several non-existence results, and give some dynamical consequences.

         I will present two results, one in cooperation with Urs Frauenfelder and Christian Lange and one in cooperation with Marco Mazzucchelli. Gromoll \&amp; Grove proved that every Besse Riemannian metric on $S^2$ is already Zoll. I will explain a generalization to real Hamiltonian structures on $\mathbb R P^3$. The main step is a characterization of orbifold quotients of $\mathbb R P^3$. The second result characterizes Zoll metrics on $S^2$ by the coincidence of the Lusternik-Schnirelman critical values on the space of unoriented embeddings of $S^1$ into $S^2$. The main step is the construction of a nonvanishing cohomology class on a neighborhood of the simple closed geodesics.

         By remarkable progress in quantum computing, interest in quantum-resistant cryptography has increased, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has begun a process to develop post-quantum cryptography standardization. Lattice-based cryptography is one of the promising candidates of post-quantum cryptography, which provides higher security based on the worst-case hardness of lattice problems.

In this paper, we propose new key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), EMBLEM and R.EMBLEM, based on the learning with errors (LWE) problem. First, we propose a new alternative of message encoding for LWE-based encryption schemes. Our encoding method is a new approach in that it does not require any rounding operation (for comparison) in the decryption phase. And this allows us to more intuitively extend to multi-bit encoding. We also adopt the binary LWE to reduce the overall computational complexity. In other words, by using the binary (\textit{or} small secret) LWE, we can encode multiple bits at a time without increasing the size of modulus $q$.

We set parameters so that our proposed KEMs have a negligible probability of decryption failure, approximately $2^{-140}$, which allows them to meet the security requirement by NIST. We then provide the implementation results of EMBLEM and R.EMBLEM, and evaluate their performances compared to other LWE-based KEMs in the literature.

         In this talk we give an overview on the complexity of the algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP) with the focus on a particular family of algorithms: sieving algorithms. First, we explain why this problem is important and how the complexity of SVP algorithms impacts parameters for cryptographic protocols. Then, we present recent advances in memory efficient versions of sieving algorithms. Time permitting, we touch upon locality-sensitive techniques for these type of algorithms. The talk is based on joint works with Gottfried Herold and Thijs Laarhoven.

         Fully Homomorphic Encryption is a recent powerful cryptographic construction, which enables one to securely compute all functions on encrypted data, and decrypt the result of the function applied to the real data. This construction gives the possibility to securely delegate computation, which is a very important property with the increasing development of Cloud computing. Nevertheless, in current client-server frameworks, the client devices are too restricted to support pure FHE. In order to solve this problem, FHE has to be combined with primitives which incur small computation and communication cost: Symmetric Encryption schemes.

Traditional SE schemes are not suited to be combined with FHE, therefore new SE schemes with low decryption complexity are considered, as the family of stream ciphers FLIP. In this construction, the low complexity makes the security crucially depend on the properties of a Boolean function, which should be robust relatively to standard cryptographic criteria and new ones. In this talk, we will present some new criteria on Boolean function it makes arise, and families of Boolean functions with good parameters relatively to these criteria.

         It is well-known that Grover's algorithm is the optimal among quantum search algorithms in all regimes. We may also consider the problem of deciding whether an oracle is the constant zero function or a random delta function, and for this, previous known bound $O(q/\sqrt{N})$ was larger than that achievable by Grover's algorithm, which is $O(q^2/N)$. I will show that in fact the tighter bound $O(q^2/N)$ holds. Also, I will present problems closely related to this, namely, one-way-to-hiding lemma and oracle reprogramming, and discuss whether similar tight bound can be obtained for these.

         Given a random narrow matrix $\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{m \times n}$, the Learning-With-Errors (LWE) problem is to distinguish uniformly random vectors over $\mathbb{Z}_q^m$ from vectors of the form $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}$, for some secret $\mathbf{s} \in \mathbb{Z}^n$ and some small-norm noise vector $\mathbb{e} \in \mathbb{Z}^m$. While the LWE function $(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{e}) \rightarrow \mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}$ can be injective when the matrix $\mathbf{A}$ is random, it may induce a lossy function when the columns of $\mathbf{A}$ are close to the column-span of a matrix $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{Z}_q^{m \times \ell}$ of lower rank $\ell &lt; n$. Yet, the injective and lossy modes are computationally indistinguishable under the LWE assumption in dimension $\ell$. This talk will present new recent applications of the lossy mode of the LWE function.

The first one is the design of a lattice-based public-key encryption scheme with \linebreak simulation-based selective-opening security (which preserves the security of un-opened ciphertexts when some senders are corrupted) under chosen-ciphertext attacks. The second application is the construction of non-interactive distributed pseudo-random functions in the adaptive corruption setting.

         In this talk, we describe a new code-based public key encryption scheme, called McNie. McNie is a hybrid version of the McEliece and Niederreiter cryptosystems. McNie passed the 1st round of the NIST competition on Post-Quantum Cryptography. The security of McNie is reduced to the hardness of syndrome decoding. The public key involves a random generator matrix which is also used to mask the private code. This makes the system safer against known structural attacks. In particular, we apply rank-metric codes to McNie. We also discuss recent attacks on McNie.

         A multivariate quadratic Public-Key Cryptography (MQPKC) is one of the most pro\-mising alternatives for classical PKCs after the eventual coming of quantum computers. In this work, we propose a new signature scheme, HiMQ-3, based on multivariate quadratic equations with short secret key and fast performance. Our signature scheme use solvable quadratic equations with chain cross terms and consecutive cross terms unlike other MQ-signatures based on the Oil-Vinegar method. For high speed implementation and the shortest secret key size, we also design sparse version of our scheme, HiMQ-3S. We provide a direct comparison of implementation results for our scheme, Rainbow and classical ones such as RSA, ECDSA on the same platform for secure and optimal parameters at a 128-bit security level. A proposal for HiMQ-3 was submitted to the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Post-Quantum Cryptography Project.

         It is a common belief that algorithms requiring large amount of space are not practical. Sieving methods for the Shortest Vector Problem (SVP), being memory inefficient, are good examples of such algorithms: the largest SVP challenges that have been solved were solving using other memory-friendly algorithms. In this talk we present an on-going joint work with Martin Albrecht, Leo Ducas, Elena Kirshanova, Eamonn Postlethwaite and Marc Stevens on implementation of sieving algorithms for the Shortest Vector Problem. We describe technical challenges that arise when one tries to make sieving algorithms practical, and how we can overcome some of them.

         Bootstrapping is a crucial operation in Gentry's breakthrough work on fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), where a homomorphic encryption scheme evaluates its own decryption algorithm. There has been a couple of implementations of bootstrapping, among which HElib arguably marks the state-of-the-art in terms of throughput, ciphertext/message size ratio and support for large plaintext moduli.

In this work, we applied a family of ``lowest digit removal&quot; polynomials to design an improved homomorphic digit extraction algorithm which is a crucial part in bootstrapping for both FV and BGV schemes. When the secret key has 1-norm $h = ||s||_1$ and the plaintext modulus is $t = p^r$, we achieved bootstrapping depth $\log{h}+\log(\log_{p}(ht))$ in FV scheme. In case of the BGV scheme, we brought down the depth from $\log{h}+2 \log{t}$ to $\log{h}+\log{t}$.

We implemented bootstrapping for FV in the SEAL library. We also introduced another slim mode which restricts the plaintexts to batched vectors in $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$. The slim mode has similar throughput as the full mode, while each individual run is much faster and uses much smaller memory. For example, bootstrapping takes 6.75 seconds for vectors over $\text{GF}(127)$ with 64 slots and 1381 seconds for vectors over $\text{GF}(257^128)$ with 128 slots.

         In this talk, a stress reconstruction in the H(div)-conforming Raviart-Thomas space based on the Taylor-Hood displacement-pressure approximation procedure for linear elasticity is proposed. The construction is weakly symmetric and the computation is performed locally on a set of vertex patches. Due to the weak symmetry constraint, the local problems need to satisfy consistency conditions associated with all rigid body modes. The resulting error estimator constitutes a guaranteed upper bound for the error and is shown to be local efficient.

         Domain decomposition preconditioners are useful for enhancing the convergence of
an iterative method for numerical partial differential equations. Efficient preconditioners
are often consist of two ingredients, i.e., one coarse problem, and many subdomain problems.
Introduction of more subdomain problems can reduce the local problem size so that
the cost for solving local problems can become cheaper. On the other hand, the subdomain
problems can only correct residual errors locally and it makes the convergence of iterative methods
slower. Another ingredient, the coarse problem is thus introduced to correct the global residual errors. The design of the coarse problem is important in obtaining the robustness of the preconditioners to the number of subdomains, i.e., effectively correct the global residual errors.
For a model problem with highly varying and random coefficients, elaborated construction of coarse basis functions is necessary to find an effective coarse problem. Certain eigenvalue problems are formed on each interface of subdomains or on each subdomains to find suitable coarse basis functions. Estimate of conditioner numbers for the proposed preconditioner is shown. Numerical results are presented to confirm the performance of the proposed method for highly varying and random coefficient model problems.

         The least-squares functional is a reliable and ecient error estimator with global upper
and lower bounds and can be very accurate. The elementwise contributions to the global
L2 norm serves well as renement indicators in adaptive mesh-rening algorithms but
the convergence analysis is less well understood. Those local contributions do not involve
an explicit mesh-size factor and hence their reduction is unclear. The paper Bringmann,
Carstensen, and Park (Numer. Math. 2017) guarantees the plain convergence for a bulk
parameter close to one and that is far away from the arguments for rate optimality.
The axioms of adaptivity in Carstensen, Feischl, Page, and Praetorius (Comp. Math.
Appl. 2014) are not available and an alternative error estimator is derived and exploited
in Carstensen and Park (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2015) and enforces a separate marking
strategy with an overall abstract theory by Carstensen and Rabus (SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 2017).
The presentation discusses on all those aspects for the Laplace, the Stokes and the
Lame-Navier equations as in Bringmann and Carstensen (Numer. Math. 2017).
Numerical experiments confirm the proven optimal convergence rates.

         In this presentation we introduce the hybrid differences(HDM) for the static and time- dependent wave equations and a new absorbing boundary
condition, so called the discrete radial absorbing boundary condition (ABC).
The HDM is a finite difference version of the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin method, and it is simple to be implemented and has many advantages compared to the existing finite difference methods. The discrete radial ABC is obtained by directly invoking to the multipole expansion of the wave solutions, and it is in an algebraic form, which annihilates the first several terms of multipole expansions exactly. The idea stems from that of Bayless-Turkel,
and they induce ABCs in a differential operator form. The new ABC is degenerated to a quasi-Dirichlet condition, where the Dirichlet condition is replaced
by the time-extrapolation of data in the previous time steps. Numerical examples confirming the efficiency of the new ABC and HDM are presented.

         For classical and singularly perturbed parabolic equations, we present
maximum norm a posteriori error estimates that, in the singularly perturbed
regime, hold uniformly in the small perturbation parameter. The parabolic
equations are discretised in time using the backward Euler method, the
Crank-Nicolson method and the discontinuous Galerkin dG(r) method.
Both semidiscrete (no spatial discretation) and fully discrete cases will
be considered. The analysis invokes elliptic reconstructions and elliptic
a posteriori error estimates.

         A discontinuous
Galerkin method with skeletal multipliers (DGSM) is developed for
diffusion problem. Skeletal multiplier is introduced on the
edge/face of each element through the definition of a weak divergence and weak
derivative in the method. The local weak formulation is derived by
weakly imposing the Dirichlet boundary condition and continuity of
fluxes and solutions on the edges/faces. The global weak
formulation is then obtained by adding all the local problems.
Equivalence of the weak formulation and the original problem is
proved. Stability of DGSM is shown and an error estimate is
derived in a broken norm. A DGSM for linear
convection-diffusion-reaction problems is also derived. An
explanation on algorithmic aspects is given. Some numerical
results are presented. Singularities due to discontinuities in the
diffusion coefficients are accurately approximated.
Internal/boundary layers are well captured without showing
spurious oscillations. Robustness of the method in increasingly
small diffusivity is demonstrated on the whole domain.

         In this talk we present two postprocessing schemes which construct some higher order $H^1$-conforming eigenfunction approximations for the Raviart--Thomas mixed finite elements. The purpose of these schemes is two-fold. First, they are used to improve the convergence rate of the eigenvalue approximation via the well-known Rayleigh quotient formula. Second, they lead to asymptotically exact error estimators for the $L^2$ errors of the eigenfunctions. In the first scheme we solve a global primal source problem using a higher order conforming space. It is shown that a higher order eigenfunction approximation can be obtained even on non-uniform meshes by virtue of the superconvergence result of the scalar eigenfunction approximation. The second scheme is local in nature as the main computation lies in solving local source problems. But it relies on a superconvergent vector approximation and thus applies only to low-order elements. Besides a higher convergence rate is ensured for mildly structured meshes.

         We develop a framework which allows us to prove the essential general quasi-orthogo\-nality for
non-symmetric and indefinite problems as the stationary Stokes problem or certain transmission problems. General quasi-orthogonality is a necessary ingredient of rate optimality proofs and is the major difficulty on the way to prove rate optimal convergence of adaptive algorithms for many strongly non-symmetric or indefinite problems. The proof exploits a new connection between the general quasi-orthogonality and LU-factorization of infinite matrices.

         Let $R$ be a real closed field, $S\subset R^k$ be a semi-algebraic set and consider the rational (co-)homology groups of $S$. It is a fundamental problem in
computational real algebraic geometry to compute the dimensions of these rational vector spaces. We consider the special case, when the semi-algebraic
set is defined by symmetric polynomials of fixed degree. The action of the symmetric group $S^k$ on $R^k$ gives these groups then the structure of a $S_k$-module. We study the associated isotypic decomposition and show bounds on the multiplicities of the irreducible representation appearing in this decomposition. In particular, we study the trivial representation, which is naturally isomorphic to the equivariant Homology groups, and given an algorithm with polynomially bounded (in $k$) complexity for computing these equivariant Betti numbers. We then discuss how this algorithm can be extended to an algorithm to compute the (ordinary) Betti numbers of S.

         Computed tomography (CT)provides benefits in accurate diagnosis of bony deformities. However, the potential adverse effect of radiation exposure has become a concern, especially in a pediatric population as children are more susceptible to the effects of radiation. To reduce radiation dose while maintaining the accuracy of diagnosis, some systems have been proposed to reconstruct 3D bony shapes from calibrated bi-planar X-ray images. However, there are some problems to apply those systems to the actual medical environment.
We propose a mobile application that reconstructs the 3D shape from uncalibrated radiographs. The user was required to take photos of AP and LAT radiographs with a iPad and segment the silhouette of the femur. If the user labels a part of the bone through the touch interface, the remaining bone parts are automatically extracted by the graph-cut algorithm. Each radiographic image is automatically aligned using a iterative PNP algorithm to match the silhouette of the statistical shape model, and then the shape of the femur is optimized.

         Deciding nonnegativity of real polynomials is a key question in real algebraic geometry with crucial importance in polynomial optimization. It is well-known that in general this problem is co-NP-hard, therefore one is interested in finding sufficient conditions (certificates) for nonnegativity, which are easier to check. Since the 19th century, sums of squares (SOS) are a standard certificate for nonnegativity, which can be recognized using semidefinite programming. This approach, however, has some issues, especially in practice if the optimization problem has many variables or high degree.

In this talk I will introduce sums of nonnegative circuit polynomials (SONC). SONC polynomials are
certain sparse polynomials having a special structure in terms of their Newton polytopes and supports and serve as a nonnegativity certificate for real polynomials, which is independent of sums of squares.

Moreover I will give an overview about polynomial optimization via SONC polynomials. Similar as SOS correspond to SDP, the new SONC certificates correspond to geometric programming and relative entropy programming. Based on a Positivstellensatz for SONC polynomials we establish a converging hierarchy of efficiently computable lower bounds for constrained optimization problems.

The talk is based on joint work with Sadik Iliman and Timo de Wolff.

For unlabeled image points we design an algorithm that solves the triangulation problem with unknown correspondences. Further we deduce algebraic relations between unlabeled image points.

         Bregman-divergence is a well-known generalized distance framework in various applications, such as machine learning and computer vision. In this talk, by using dual structure of the Bregman-divergence associated with the subclass of convex function of Legendre function, we analyze the structure of the Legendre exponential families whose cumulant function corresponds to the conjugate convex function of Legendre type. Actually, Legendre exponential families are the extended version of the regular exponential families to include non-regular exponential families, such as the inverse Gaussian distribution. The main advantage of the proposed Bregman-divergence-based approach is that it offers systematic successive approximation tools to handle closed domain issues arising in non-regular exponential families and the statistical distributions having discrete random variables, such as Bernoulli distribution and Poisson distribution. In the end, as an application for computer vision, we introduce the generalized center-based clustering algorithm based on the extended Tweedie distribution.

         Recently, deep learning approaches with various network architectures have achieved significant performance improvement over existing iterative reconstruction methods in various imaging problems. However, it is still unclear {\em why} these deep learning architectures work for specific inverse problems. Moreover, in contrast to the usual evolution of signal processing theory around the classical theories, the link between deep learning and the classical signal processing approaches such as wavelets, non-local processing, compressed sensing, etc, are not yet well understood. To address these issues, here we show that the long-searched-for missing link is the convolution framelets for representing a signal by convolving local and non-local bases. The convolution framelets was originally developed to generalize the theory of low-rank Hankel matrix approaches for inverse problems, and this paper further extends the idea so that we can obtain a deep neural network using multilayer convolution framelets with perfect reconstruction (PR) under rectilinear linear unit nonlinearity (ReLU). Our analysis also shows that the popular deep network components such as residual block, redundant filter channels, and concatenated ReLU (CReLU) do indeed help to achieve the PR, while the pooling and unpooling layers should be augmented with high-pass branches to meet the PR condition. Moreover, by changing the number of filter channels and bias, we can control the shrinkage behaviors of the neural network. This discovery reveals the limitations of many existing deep learning architectures for inverse problems, and leads us to propose a novel theory for {\em deep convolutional framelets} neural network. Using numerical experiments with various inverse problems, we demonstrated that our deep convolution framelets network shows consistent improvement over
existing deep architectures. This discovery suggests that the success of deep learning is not from a magical power of a black-box, but rather comes from the power of a novel signal representation using non-local basis combined with data-driven local basis, which is indeed a natural extension of classical signal processing theory.

         Visual events in computer vision are studied from the perspective of algebraic geometry. Given a sufficiently general curve or surface in 3-space, we consider the image or contour curve that arises by projecting from a viewpoint. Qualitative changes in that curve occur when the viewpoint crosses the visual event surface. We examine the components of this ruled surface, observe that these coincide with the iterated singular loci of the coisotropic hypersurfaces associated with the original curve or surface, and show how to compute exact representations for all visual event surfaces using algebraic methods.

         Mustafin varieties are flat degenerations of projective spaces induced by a choice of an $n$-tuple of lattices in a vector space over a non-archimedean field. These varieties have a rich combinatorial structure as can be seen in pioneering work of Cartwright, H\&quot;abich, Sturmfels and Werner. In this talk, we give a new description for Mustafin varieties in terms of images of rational maps, which were studied by Li. We completely classify the irreducible components of Mustafin varieties associated to a tuple of lattices. We relate Mustafin varieties for convex point configurations to Shimura varieties and certain moduli functors which appear in the limit linear series theory developed by Osserman called prelinked Grassmannians. Our methods include tropical convex hull computations and tropical intersection theory. This is talk is based on joint work with Binglin Li.

         Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is an imaging technique that is currently revolutionizing structural biology; the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 was awarded to Joachim Frank, Richard Henderson and Jacques Dubochet “for developing cryo-electron micro\-scopy for the high-resolution structure determination of biomolecules in solution”. Following cryo-EM experiments, one receives many very noisy 2D images of varying conformations of a 3D molecule, each taken from an unknown viewing direction. The noise, conformational variability, unknown orientations and big size of data are all aspects of cryo-EM which make reconstructing the 3D structure from the 2D images a formidable task.

In this talk, I will place cryo-EM reconstruction inside a mathematical framework for statistical learning under group actions. The framework is rather general, and also applies to problems from signal processing, computer vision and computer graphics.

The main result is the determination of the sample complexity for statistical learning under group actions, in high generality, in terms of the invariant theory of the underlying symmetry group. For cryo-EM, we contribute a novel ab initio 3D reconstruction algorithm which is sample-efficient and takes a single-pass through image data.

         The scaling behaviour of diffraction intensities near the origin has been used to classify the order of a structure, in particular with respect to the notion of hyperuniformity. In our talk, we address the scaling with some of the known techniques and results from rigorous diffraction theory. In particular, we consider substitution or inflation-based systems, for which we can employ renormalisation-type arguments, and link the scaling behaviour to Lyapunov exponents of a matrix iteration.

         The diffraction spectrum of an inflation tiling is given by the Fourier transform of its pair correlations, for which exact renormalisation equations have been developed recently. After reviewing these, we concentrate on the absolutely continuous (ac) part of the spectrum, which must satisfy the renormalisation equations separately. This allows us to derive necessary conditions for the existence of ac spectrum, and in fact to rule it out in many cases. We illustrate these techniques with a number of
examples in one and two dimensions, where such a result was not previously known.

         An important family of mathematical quasicrystals is generated by the ``cut and project&quot; method. The principle is to project on a lower-dimensional plane a ``slice&quot; of a higher-dimensional lattice. The properties of the resulting point-set depend crucially on the slope of the lower-dimensional plane.
I will present some results regarding the repetition properties of a point-set obtained by using a ``typical&quot; slope, in a measure-theoretic sense. This results extends some old results by Morse and Hedlund related to Sturmian sequences, and are based on techniques of Diophantine approximation.

Which $\ell$ is best? Which is second best?

This is Diophantine approximation for the rational points in the unit circle. We will introduce a dynamical system originally defined by Romik in 2008, study its Lagrange and Markov spectra, and explain how our results can answer the above questions.

         We discuss spectral characteristics of a one-dimensional quantum walk whose coins are distributed quasi-periodically. The unitary update rule of this quantum walk shares many spectral characteristics with the critical Almost-Mathieu Operator; however, it possesses a feature not present in the Almost-Mathieu Operator, namely singularity of the associated cocycles (this feature is, however, present in the so-called Extended Harper's Model). We show that this operator has empty absolutely continuous spectrum and that the Lyapunov exponent vanishes on the spectrum; hence, this model exhibits Cantor spectrum of zero Lebesgue measure for all irrational frequencies and arbitrary phase, which in physics is known as Hofstadter's butterfly. In fact, we will show something stronger, namely, that all spectral parameters in the spectrum are of critical type, in the language of Avila's global theory of analytic quasiperiodic cocycles. We further prove that it has empty point spectrum for each irrational frequency and away from a frequency-dependent set of phases having Lebesgue measure zero. The key ingredients in our proofs are an adaptation of Avila's Global Theory to the present setting, self-duality via the Fourier transform, and a Johnson-type theorem for singular dynamically defined CMV matrices which characterizes their spectra as the set of spectral parameters at which the associated cocycles fail to admit a dominated splitting.

         The diffraction measure is a useful tool which can be used to determine the order (or disorder) of a point set. Very ordered sets lead to a pure point diffraction measure. Since it is generally not easy to compute this measure, it is desirable to find equivalent characterisations. In this talk, we will discuss mean almost periodicity and its relation to pure point diffractive sets.

         I will discuss recent work with Henna Koivusalo that concerns the question of which Euclidean cut and project schemes with polytopal windows lead to patterns that are linearly repetitive. This builds upon previous work with Haynes and Koivusalo resolving the question for so-called `cubical windows'. We find a necessary and sufficient condition for linear repetitivity which applies to a large class of schemes satisfying a minor natural strengthening of the standard `almost canonical' property. The condition, and the proof of equivalence with linear repetitivity, involves an interesting blend of discrete geometry and Diophantine approximation.

         An infinite sequence $x$ is called a Toeplitz sequence if each word in $x$ occurs periodically in $x$. A subshift is called Toeplitz if it is an orbit closure of a Toeplitz sequence. In 80's Williams showed that any nonnegative real number can be realized as a topological entropy of a Toeplitz subshift. If a system has entropy 0, then the notion of entropy dimension can be used to capture the subexponential complexity of zero entropy systems. Given a real number $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we construct regular and nonregular Toeplitz subshifts with entropy dimension $\alpha$. Furthermore, for each positive integer $n$, we present a nonregular Toeplitz subshift with entropy dimension $\alpha$ which has at least $n$ ergodic measures. This is a joint work with Jungseob Lee, Kyewon Koh Park, and Jisang Yoo.

         We will discuss the relation between Hausdorff dimension of badly approximable vectors in inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation and the entropy of a certain flow on a homogeneous space. We will also explain that maximality of such Hausdorff dimension implies invariance of the set under a certain subgroup of the (affine) special linear group. This is partly a joint work with U. Shapira and N. de Saxce, and partly a joint work with Y. Bugeaud, D. Kim, and M. Rams.

In the nucleation regime almost spherical droplets appear, and
we approximate the infinite dimensional stochastic
dynamics of these droplets by the motion along a
finite dimensional slow manifold. The main results
are effective equations (given by stochastic ordinary
differential equations) on the slow manifold and the
stochastic stability of the manifold.

         We prove existence of a diffusion process whose invariant measure is the fractional polymer or Edwards measure for fractional Brownian motion in dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}$ with Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$ fulfilling $Hd\leq 1$. The diffusion is constructed via Dirichlet form techniques in infinite dimensional (Gaussian) analysis.
In the case $Hd&lt;1$ by providing a Fukushima decomposition for the stochastic quantization of the fractional Edwards measure we show that the constructed process solves weakly a stochastic differential equation in infinite dimension for quasi–all starting points. Moreover, the solution process is driven by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process taking values in an infinite dimensional space and is unique, in the sense that the underlying Dirichlet form is Markov unique. The equilibrium measure, which is by construction the fractional Edwards measure, is specified to be an extremal Gibbs state.

         By Ito's formula the time marginals of a solution to a distribution dependent SDE solve a nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation. This talk is about the converse: we present a general technique how to identify a solution to a nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation consisting of probability densities as the time marginals of a solution to a distribution dependent SDE. We apply this to the special case of a porous media equation perturbed by the divergence of a vector field depending nonlinearly on the solution. More precisely, we construct a generalized entropic solution $u$ to this equation and apply the above general technique to find the corresponding distribution dependent SDE which has a weak solution with marginals given by $u$. We thus gain a probabilistic representation of $u$. The final aim is to develop a general theory relating distribution dependent SDE and nonlinear Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations analogous to the classical linear case.

         We investigate geometric properties of Weierstrass curves with two components, representing series based on trigonometric functions.
They are seen to be $\frac{1}{2}-$ H\&quot;older continuous,
and are not (para-)controlled with respect to each other in the sense of the recently established Fourier analytic approach of rough path analysis. Their graph is represented as an attractor of a smooth random dynamical system. Our argument that its graph has Hausdorff dimension 2 is in the spirit of Ledrappier-Young's approach of the Hausdorff dimension of attractors. For one dimensional versions of the curves we establish duality between smoothness of the Sinai-Bowen-Ruelle measure of the dynamical system and the existence of a local time. This is joint work with G. dos Reis (U Edinburgh) and O. Pamen (U Liverpool and AIMS Ghana).

         We study a class of Hermitian random matrices
which includes Wigner matrices, heavy-tailed
random matrices, and sparse random matrices such as adjacency matrices
of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs with $p_n\sim\frac 1 n$. Our $n\times n$
random matrices have real entries which are i.i.d. up to symmetry. The distribution of entries
depends on $n$, and we require row sums to converge in
distribution; it is then well-known that the limit
distribution must be infinitely divisible.

We show that a limiting empirical spectral distribution
(LSD) exists, and
via local weak convergence of associated graphs, the LSD corresponds to the
spectral measure associated to the root of a graph which is formed by connecting infinitely many Poisson
weighted infinite trees using a backbone structure of special edges called ``cords to infinity''. One example covered by
the results are matrices with i.i.d. entries having infinite second
moments, but normalized to be in the Gaussian domain of attraction. In this case, the limiting graph is $\mathbb{N}$ rooted at 1, so the LSD is
the semi-circle law.

         In this talk we discuss the heat diffusion under stochastic disturbance in a domain with boundary. The zero temperature control on the boundary forces the temperature to change in steep manner. This change near boundary is steep under deterministic disturbance and it gets much steeper under stochastic disturbance. In particular, the derivatives of the temperature near the boundary may blow up. To describe this behavior we are to use appropriate weights near the boundary. As the behavior depends on the shape of boundary, the weight has to be customized accordingly. We discuss this with half space domains and infinite wedge domains in $\mathbb{R}^2$.

         Glassy materials in physics are often described by a class of SPDE with a particular multiplicative noise structure also known from macroscopic fluctuation theory. The easiest example is the so-called Dean-Kawasaki equations for super cooled liquids. We show that this SPDE is fundamentally ill-posed in the interesting parameter regimes and propose a correction which allows for solutions in terms of zero-range interacting particle systems which undergo a continuous branching and coagulation mechanism. Moreover, we show that this process realizes a Wasserstein diffusion in the sense of an associated Varadhan formula for the short time asymptotics governed by the quadratic Wasserstein metric of optimal transportation.

         It is well known that harmonic functions and p-harmonic functions have
higher interior regularity. In 1957 De Giorgi introduced a new
technique that allows to obtain interior estimates of the form
\begin{align*}
\max_B |u|^p &amp;\leq c\, \frac{1}{|2B|}\int_{2B} |u|^p\,dx.
\end{align*}
A similar result holds for $p$ harmonic functions. The proof is based
on a subtle use of truncation operators and Cacciopoli estimates.
In this talk we extend this technique and result to the setting of finite element
solutions. Our solutions can be scalar valued as well as vector
valued, which makes a big difference for~$p$-harmonic functions.

Such estimates are of strong interest, since these estimates provide
an alternative approach to the $L^\infty$-estimates of Schatz-Wahlbin
for discretely harmonic functions (linear case). The main novelty of
our approach is that we allow for fully adaptive meshes in contrast to
uniform or slowly graded meshes.

         In this talk, we study global gradient estimates for weak solutions from composite materials. We assume that the domain is composed of a finite number of disjoint subdomains with Reifenberg flat boundaries and the coefficients are merely measurable in one variable and have small BMO semi-norms in the other variables on each subdomain. Our proof is based on a new observation for disjoint Reifenberg flat domains $\Omega^{k}$ and $\Omega^{l}$ that the normal vectors at $P \in \partial \Omega^{k}$ and $Q \in \partial \Omega^{l}$ are almost opposite if $P$ and $Q$ are close enough.

         We consider a class of doubly nonlinear history-dependent diffusion equations.
Our assumptions on the kernel include the case of a fractional derivative
in the sense of Riemann-Liouville. Equations of this type have been proposed to model flows of fluids when memory effects arise.
Existence and uniqueness of entropy solutions is established for general integrable data and Dirichlet
boundary conditions.
In the proof of existence the so-called fundamental identity is combind with a new regularization technique and classical monotonicity arguments.

         We consider $p$-Poisson equation with the right-hand side in divergence form:
$$-{\rm div}(A(\nabla u))=-{\rm div} (|\nabla
u|^{{p-2}}\nabla u)= -{\rm div} F. $$ It is known that the non-linear mapping $F\to A(\nabla u)$ satisfies the linear, optimal estimate $\|A(\nabla u)\|_X \le c\|F\|_X$ for several choices of spaces $X$ (Lebesgue spaces $L^q$ for $q\ge p'$, H\&quot;older spaces $C^{0,\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\ge 0$, BMO).
Our main result is the following Calder\'on-Zygmund-type regularity estimate in terms of the norm of the Besov Space $$\|A(\nabla u)\|_{B^s_{\rho,q}} \lesssim\|F\|_{B^s_{\rho,q}} + \text{lower order terms}.$$
The estimate is restricted to the case of the plane and $p\ge 2$.

         The talk deals with the Cauchy-Dirichlet problem for parabolic systems of $p$-Laplace type on non-cylindrical domains in space-time. In other words, we consider spatial domains whose shape varies in time. In the case of a growing domain, the boundary values can be interpreted as additional initial conditions, while in the case of a shrinking domain, the boundary values can be seen as a kind of obstacle condition. The treatment of time-varying domains turns out to be significantly harder than the standard case of cylindrical domains. We present an existence result for solutions to such problems under very weak regularity assumptions on the domain. A first regularity result for the constructed solutions guarantees that they depend continuously on time with respect to the $L^2$-norm if the domain does not shrink too fast.

         In this talk we collect some very recent estimates for the gradient of solutions, and for the solutions themselves, to the $p$-Laplace system with right-hand side in divergence form. Both estimates inside the domain for local solutions, and global estimates for solutions to boundary value problems are discussed. Their formulation involves sharp maximal operators, whose properties enable us to translate some aspects of the elliptic regularity theory into a merely harmonic–analytic framework. As a consequence, a flexible, comprehensive approach to estimates for solutions to the $p$-Laplace system for a broad class of norms is derived. In particular, global estimates under minimal boundary regularity are presented.

         This talk studies classical magnetohydrodynamic shock waves in an
inviscid fluidic plasma that is assumed to be a perfect conductor of electricity.
It identifies, partly numerically, partly analytically, critical manifolds in parameter space, across which slow or fast MHD shock waves undergo emergence of a complex conjugate pair of unstable transverse modes. For slow shocks, this emergence occurs in a particularly interesting way
already in the parallel case, in which it happens at the spectral value
$\hat\lambda\equiv\lambda/|\omega|=0$ and the critical manifold possesses an explicit
algebraic representation. Within the set of non-parallel slow shocks the unstable mode pair
emerges from \emph{two}\ generically different spectral values $\hat\lambda=\pm i\gamma$.
For fast shocks, the critical manifold does not intersect the parallel regime, while the emergence
within the set of non-parallel fast shocks again starts from two\ generically different
spectral values.

         We study the strong solution to the 3-D compressible Navier--Stokes equations. We propose a new blow up criterion for barotropic gases in terms of the integral norm of density $\rho$ and the divergence of the velocity $\mathbf u$ without any restriction on the physical viscosity constants. Our blow up criteria can be seen as a partial realization of the underlying principle that the higher integrability implies the boundedness and then eventual regularity. We also present similar blow up criterion for the heat conducting gases.

         Mathematical models that describe the dynamics two-phase flows can be
classified as either sharp-interface (SI) models or diffuse-interface (DI)
models. For compressible liquid-vapour flow the first case results in
a mixed-type elliptic-hyperbolic free boundary value problem. In the
DI case one obtains higher-order systems like the class of
Navier-Stokes-Korteweg equations which include e.g. third-order derivatives
of the density. In both cases the mixed or complex type of the
systems makes the analysis of the systems quite intricate, with many questions
on wellposedness still being open.

In the talk we propose a new hyperbolic-parabolic model approach to
DI models that can be seen as an approximation of the original DI model.
This approximation will be justified rigorously.
One can apply standard analytical techniques
to exploit the underlying hyperbolic structure. In particular we will
derive a new homogenization limit that governs compressible two-phase
flow in a porous medium.

We will first discuss a global well-posedness of radial case in energy space by adopting Kenig-Merle arguments when the initial energy and initial kinetic energy are less than those of ground state, respectively. For this purpose long time perturbation, profile decomposition and localized virial inequality are utilized. As an application of the localized virial inequality I will provide a time blowup for energy critical Hartree equations via commutator technique.

         The talk will present some recent results of the group in Magdeburg in connection with phase mixtures and phase transitions. These results include some modeling aspects as well as solutions to Riemann problems for systems of conservation laws that model mixtures of water and vapor. The mixture systems are weakly hyperbolic systems. When the terms modelling phase transitions between the liquid and vapor states are turned off, delta shocks can occur. They indicate that a phase transition should take place. Various examples are discussed.

         Quasilinear mixed order systems arise in countless applications
in natural sciences and technology. Important representatives of this
class of PDE are free boundary problems in fluid dynamics.
Relying on the maximal regularity approach,
not seldom intricate nonlinearities of quasilinear mixed order systems
have to be estimated in anisotropic (in space and time) function spaces.
In my talk I would like to present recently derived results on
multiplication and analytic Nemytskii operators on scales of anisotropic
function spaces. By these results the estimation of nonlinear terms is
essentially reduced to verifying an elementary condition for the
corresponding anisotropic Sobolev indices.
In the second part of my talk it is demonstrated, how these results can
be utilized in order to derive well-posedness for a
fluid-structure-interaction model.

         In many cases, the movement of species within a region depends on the availability of food and other resources necessary for its survival. Starvation driven diffusion (SDD) is a dispersal strategy that increases the motility of biological organisms in unfavorable environments, i.e., a species moves more frequently in search of food if resources are insufficient (Cho and Kim, 2013). In this study, the proposed model represents the dispersion of an invasive species undergoing SDD, where the free boundary represents the expanding front. We observe that the spreading-vanishing dichotomy, which holds in the linear dispersal model (Zhou and Xiao, 2013), also holds in the model undergoing SDD. We also provide the estimates for the spreading speed of the free boundary during the spreading process. Finally, our results are compared with the results of the linear dispersal model to investigate the advantages of this strategic dispersal with respect to survival in new environments.

         <abstract>
         The classical parabolic-elliptic Keller-Segel system
is considered under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions in the ball $\Omega=B_R(0)\subset \mathbb R^n$.

The main objective is to reveal that in the context of radially symmetric solutions, this problem exhibits an apparently novel type of critical mass phenomenon: It is shown, namely, that for any choice of $n\ge 2$ and $R&gt;0$ there exists a positive number $m_c=m_c(n,R)$ with the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Whenever $m&gt;m_c$, for any nonconstant nonnegative radial initial data $u_0$ with $\int_\Omega u_0=m$
which are, in an appropriately defined sense, more concentrated than the associated spatially homogeneous
equilibrium determined by $u\equiv \frac{m}{|\Omega|}$, the corresponding initial-value problem
admits a solution blowing up in finite time;
in particular, this implies that any nonconstant and radially nonincreasing initial data $u_0$ with $\int_\Omega u_0&gt;m_c$
enforce blow-up.
\item
If $m&lt;m_c$, however, then there exist infinitely many nonnegative radial functions $u_0$
which satisfy $\int_\Omega u_0=m$ and which are more concentrated
than $u\equiv \frac{m}{|\Omega|}$, but which yet
allow for global bounded solutions emanating from $u_0$.
\end{itemize}

In consequence, precisely at mass levels above $m_c$ the constant steady states of the system possess the extreme instability property of repelling arbitrary concentration-increasing perturbations in such a drastic sense that corresponding trajectories collapse in finite time.

A mathematical model in the form of coupled bulk-surface reaction-drift-diffusion system is introduced that has some similarity with classical chemotaxis models. We evaluate the well-posedness of the system.

         Macroscopic models for systems involving diffusion, short-range repulsion, and long-range attraction have been studied extensively in the last decades. In this paper we extend the analysis to a system for two species interacting with each other according to different inner- and intra-species attractions. Under suitable conditions on this self- and crosswise attraction an interesting effect can be observed, namely phase separation into neighboring regions, each of which contains only one of the species. We prove that the intersection of the support of the stationary solutions of the continuum model for the two species has zero Lebesgue measure, while the support of the sum of the two densities is a connected interval. Preliminary results indicate the existence of phase separation, i.e., spatial sorting of the different species. A detailed analysis is given in one spatial dimension. The existence and shape of segregated stationary solutions is shown via the Krein–Rutman theorem. Moreover, for small repulsion/nonlinear diffusion, also uniqueness of these stationary states is proved.

         We study the evolution of vortex filaments in ideal fluids. A conjecture, dating back to da Rios in 1906, states that if the vorticity is initially concentrated around a closed curve, it remains concentrated for some time and the evolution of the curve is geometrically described by the binormal curvature flow. We focus on the second part of this conjecture and derive the binormal curvature flow under a weak vorticity concentration condition. Our proof relies on estimates for the underlying Hamiltonian structures.

         Collective coordinated motion of autonomous self-propelled agents with self-organiza\-tion into robust patterns appears in many applications ranging from animal herding to the emergence of common languages. Apart from its biological and evolutionary relevance, collective phenomena play a prominent role in many other scientific disciplines, such as robotics, control theory, economics and social sciences. In this talk, we will consider kinetic type models describing the collective behaviors and discuss a quantitative estimate of a large friction limit to a continuity equation with nonlocal velocity fields, called aggregation equations, by employing 2-Wasserstein distance.

         We propose and investigate additive density regression, a novel additive functional regression model for situations where the responses are random distributions that can be viewed as random densities and the predictors are vectors. Data in the form of samples of densities or distributions are increasingly encountered in statistical analysis and there is a need for flexible regression models that accommodate random densities as responses. Such models are of special interest for multivariate continuous predictors, where unrestricted nonparametric regression approaches are subject to the curse of dimensionality. Additive models can be expected to maintain one-dimensional rates of convergence while permitting a substantial degree of flexibility. This motivates the development of additive regression models for situations where multivariate continuous predictors are coupled with densities as responses. To overcome the problem that distributions do not form a vector space, we utilize a class of transformations that map densities to unrestricted square integrable functions and then deploy an additive functional regression model to fit the responses in the unrestricted space, finally transforming back to density space. We implement the proposed additive model with an extended version of smooth backfitting and
establish the consistency of this approach, including rates of convergence. The proposed method is
illustrated with an application to the distributions of baby names in the United States.

         We consider statistical models where functional data are artificially contaminated by independent Wiener processes in order to satisfy privacy constraints. We show that the corrupted observations have a Wiener density which determines the distribution of the original functional random variables, masked near the origin, uniquely, and we construct a nonparametric estimator of that density. We derive an upper bound for its mean integrated squared error which has a polynomial convergence rate, and we establish an asymptotic lower bound on the minimax convergence rates which is close to the rate attained by our estimator. Our estimator requires the choice of a basis and of two smoothing parameters. We propose data-driven ways of choosing them and prove that the asymptotic quality of our estimator is not significantly affected by the empirical parameter selection. We examine the numerical performance of our method via simulated examples.

         We study the problem of estimating a functional $\theta(\mathbb P)$ of an unknown probability distribution $\mathbb P \in\mathcal P$ in which the original iid sample $X_1,\dots, X_n$ is kept private even from the statistician via an $\alpha$-local differential privacy constraint. Let $\omega_{TV}$ denote the modulus of continuity of the functional $\theta$ over $\mathcal P$, with respect to total variation distance. For a large class of loss functions $l$, we prove that the privatized minimax risk is equivalent to $l(\omega_{TV}(n^{-1/2}))$ to within constants, under regularity conditions that are satisfied, in particular, if $\theta$ is linear and $\P$ is convex. Our results complement the theory developed by Donoho and Liu (1991) with the nowadays highly relevant case of privatized data. Somewhat surprisingly, the difficulty of the estimation problem in the private case is characterized by $\omega_{TV}$, whereas, it is characterized by the Hellinger modulus of continuity if the original data $X_1,\dots, X_n$ are available. We also provide a general recipe for constructing rate optimal privatization mechanisms and illustrate the general theory in numerous examples. Our theory allows to quantify the price to be paid for local differential privacy in a large class of estimation problems.

         One central task in comparative politics is to locate party positions in a certain political space. For this purpose, several empirical methods have been proposed using text as data sources. In general,
the analysis of texts to extract information is a difficult task. Its data structure is very complex and political texts usually contain a large number of words such that a simultaneous analysis of word counts becomes challenging. In this paper, we consider Poisson models for each word count simultaneously and provide a statistical analysis suitable for political text data. In particular, we allow for multi-dimensional party positions and develop a data-driven way of determining the dimension of positions. Allowing for multi-dimensional political positions gives new
insights in the evolution of party positions and helps our understanding of a political system. Additionally, we consider a novel model which allows the political lexicon to change over time and develop an estimation procedure based on LASSO and fused LASSO penalization techniques
to address high-dimensionality via significant dimension reduction. The latter model extension gives more insights into the potentially changing use of words by left and right-wing parties over time. Furthermore, the procedure is capable to identify automatically words having a discriminating
effect between party positions. To address the potential dependence structure of the word counts over time, we included integer-valued time series processes into our modeling approach and we implemented a suitable bootstrap method to construct confidence intervals for the
model parameters. We apply our approach to party manifesto data from German parties over all seven federal elections after German reunification. The approach is simply implemented as it does not require any a priori information (from external source) nor expert knowledge to
process the data. The data studies confirm that our procedure is robust, runs stable and leads to meaningful and interpretable results.

         This paper is concerned with inference about low-dimensional components of a high-dimensional parameter vector β which is identified through instrumental variables. We allow for eigenvalues of the expected outer product of included and excluded covariates, denoted by M, to shrink to zero as the sample size increases. We propose a novel estimator based on desparsification of an instrumental variable Lasso estimator, which is a regularized version of 2SLS with an additional correction term. This estimator converges to β at a rate depending on the mapping properties of M captured by a sparse link condition. Linear combinations of our estimator of β are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed. Based on consistent covariance estimation, our method allows for constructing confidence intervals and statistical tests for single or low-dimensional components of β. In Monte-Carlo simulations we analyze the finite sample behavior of our estimator.

         In this paper we develop a data-driven smoothing technique for non-linear panel data models. We allow for individual specific (non-linear) functions and estimation with econometric or machine learning methods by using weighted observations from other individuals. The weights are determined by a data-driven way and depend on the similarity between the corresponding functions and are measured based on initial estimates. The key feature of such a procedure is that it clusters individuals based on the distance / similarity between them, estimated in a first stage. Our estimation method can be combined with various statistical estimation procedures, in particular modern machine learning methods which are in particular fruitful in the high-dimensional case and with complex, heterogeneous data. The methods can also be applied for estimation of Random Coefficient models and for estimation of nonparametric functions with many categorical variables (\textquotedblleft cells\textquotedblright). The theoretical properties of the proposed estimator are derived which improve on many classical methods. We conduct a simulation study which shows that the prediction can be greatly improved by using our estimator. Finally, we analyze a big data set from didichuxing.com, a leading company in transportation industry, to analyze and predict the gap between supply and demand based on a large set of covariates. Our estimator clearly performs much better in out-of-sample prediction compared to existing non-linear panel data estimators.

         For inference on means of random vectors, the central limit theorem (CLT) is a central tool. Fr\'echet (1948) extended the notion of means to arbitrary metric spaces, as minimizers of expected squared distance. For such, under mild conditions, a strong law has been provided 1977 by Ziezold and, in case of manifolds and additional stronger conditions, a CLT has been derived by Bhattacharya and Paragenaru (2005). In a local chart, this CLT features a classical normal limiting distribution with a classical rate of inverse square root of sample size.

If these additional stronger conditions are not satisfied, CLTs may still hold but feature different rates and different limit distributions. We give examples of such ``dirty&quot; limit theorems featuring faster rates (stickiness) and slower rates (smeariness). The former may occur on NNC (nonnegative curvature) spaces, here the distribution around cut loci of means plays a central role, the latter on NPC (nonpositive curvature) spaces. Both effects may have serious practical applications.

         This paper is concerned with inference on the cumulative distribution function (cdf) $F_{X^{*}}$ in the classical measurement error model $X=X^{*}+\epsilon$. We show validity of asymptotic and bootstrap approximations for the distribution of the deviation in the sup-norm between the deconvolution cdf estimator of Hall and Lahiri (2008) and $F_{X^{*}}$. We allow the density of $\epsilon$ to be ordinary or super smooth, or to be estimated by repeated measurements. Our approximation results are applicable to various contexts, such as confidence bands for $F_{X^{*}}$ and its quantiles, and for performing various cdf-based tests such as goodness-of-fit tests for parametric models of densities, two sample homogeneity tests, and tests for stochastic dominance. Simulation and real data examples illustrate satisfactory performance of the proposed methods.

the other one is Bayesian and uses Bayesian calculus from the conjugated Wishart

         In this talk we discuss the estimation of a nonparametric component $f_1$ of a nonparametric additive model $Y=f_1(X_1) + \cdots+ f_q(X_q) + \varepsilon$. We allow the number $q$ of additive components to grow to infinity and we make sparsity assumptions about the number of nonzero additive components. We compare this estimation problem with that of estimating $f_1$ in the oracle model $Z= f_1(X_1) + \varepsilon$, for which the additive components $f_2,\dots,f_q$ are known. We construct a two-step presmoothing-and-resmoothing estimator of $f_1$ in the additive model and state finite-sample bounds for the difference between our estimator and some smoothing estimators $\hat f_1^{\text{(oracle)}}$ in the oracle model which satisfy mild conditions. In an asymptotic setting these bounds can be used to show asymptotic equivalence of our estimator and the oracle estimators; the paper thus shows that, asymptotically, under strong enough sparsity conditions, knowledge of $f_2,\dots,f_q$ has no effect on estimation accuracy. Our first step is to estimate all of the components in the additive model with undersmoothing using a group-Lasso estimator. We then construct pseudo responses $\hat Y$ by evaluating a desparsified modification of our undersmoothed estimator of $f_1$ at the design points. In the second step the smoothing method of the oracle estimator $\hat f_1^{\text{(oracle)}}$ is applied to a nonparametric regression problem with ``responses'' $\hat Y$ and covariates $X_1$.
Our mathematical exposition centers primarily on establishing properties of the presmoothing estimator. We also present simulation results demonstrating close-to-oracle performance of our estimator in practical applications. The main results of the paper are also important for understanding the behavior of the presmoothing estimator when the resmoothing step is omitted.

         Stochastic partial equations (SPDEs) arise when one models natural phenomena under random environments.
Especially, SPDEs with time fractional derivatives can be used to describe random effects on transport of particles subject to sticking and trapping. Also, SPDEs with spacial non-local operators can be used to describe random phenomena with pure jumps.
In this talk, I will present uniqueness and existence results and maximal regularity theory for stochastic partial differential equations with various non-local operators.

         In this talk, a strong approximation result for a class of stochastic mechanical systems with nonlinear holonomic constraints is presented. Such systems are described by higher-index stochastic differential-algebraic equations, involving an implicitly given Lagrange multiplier process. The explicit representation of the Lagrange multiplier leads to an underlying stochastic ordinary differential equation, whose coefficients are in general not globally monotone and of super-linear growth. Strong convergence is established for a half-explicit drift-truncated Euler scheme which fulfills the constraint exactly. Concrete examples for the considered systems are bead-rod chain models used in molecular dynamics as well as spatially discretized models for the dynamics of inextensible fibers in turbulent flows as occurring, e.g, in the spunbond production process of non-woven textiles.

         In [1], Aldous investigates a symmetric Markov chain
on cladograms and gives bounds on its mixing and relaxation times. The latter bound was sharpened in [2]. In this talk we encode cladograms as binary, algebraic measure trees and show that this Markov chain on cladograms with fixed number of leaves converges in distribution as the number of leaves goes to infinity.

We give a rigorous construction of the limit, whose existence was conjectured by Aldous, as the solution of a well-posed martingale problem. We show that the Aldous diffusion is a Feller process with continuous paths, and the algebraic measure Brownian CRT is its unique invariant distribution.

Furthermore, we consider the vector of the masses of the three subtrees connected to a sampled branch point. In the Brownian CRT, its annealed law is known to be the Dirichlet distribution. Here we give an explicit expression for the infinitesimal evolution of its quenched law under the Aldous
diffusion.

         Taking the Leray projection $\mathbb{P}$ to the following stochastic MHD equation
\begin{equation*}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&amp;(\partial_t - \Delta) \mathbf{u} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{b}) + \nabla \pi = g^k_1 \frac{dw^k}{dt} \\
&amp;(\partial_t - \Delta) \mathbf{b} + \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{b}-\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{u}) = g^k_2 \frac{dw^k}{dt} \\
&amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{b} = 0
\end{aligned}
\right.,
\end{equation*}
we formally have
\begin{equation}
\label{pro eqn}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
&amp;(\partial_t - \Delta) \mathbf{v} = - \mathbb{P}\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{w}\otimes\mathbf{v}) + G^k_1 \frac{dw^k}{dt} \\
&amp;(\partial_t - \Delta) \mathbf{w} = - \mathbb{P}\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}) + G^k_2 \frac{dw^k}{dt} \\
&amp;\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{w} = 0,
\end{aligned}
\right.,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{b}, \quad \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{b}.
\end{equation*}
We will say that $(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})$ is a (mild) solution to (1) on $(0,T)$ if it solves for $0\le t &lt; T$ the integral equations
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\mathbf{v} &amp; = S(t)\mathbf{v}_0-B(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{v}) +\int_0^t S(t-s) G^k_1(s)dw_s\\
\mathbf{w} &amp; = S(t)\mathbf{w}_0 - B(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w})+\int_0^t S(t-s) G^k_1(s)dw_s.
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

In this talk, we find optimal regularity conditions on the initial values $(\mathbf{v}_0, \mathbf{w}_0)$ and stochastic external forces $(G_1,G_2)$ to guarantee the existence of a mild solution $(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{w})$ with small initial data or within small time $T_0$.

         Consider a diffusion $X_t$ in an energy landscape $U(x)$, i.e., a solution to the stochastic differential equation $d X_t = - \nabla U(X_t) d t + \sqrt{\epsilon} d B_t$. In the small-noise limit $\epsilon \searrow 0$, the diffusion started in a local energy minimum exhibits metastable behavior - it takes a long time to reach the global minimum. The answer to the question ``how long&quot; is provided by the Eyring-Kramers law. The talk addresses similar questions for a Markov birth and death process of points in $\mathbb R^d$, where the energy landscape is replaced with the rate function of some suitable large deviations principle and the analogue of the Eyring-Kramers law brings in functional central limit theorems and infinite-dimensional Gaussians. Based on joint work in progress with Frank den Hollander, Roman Kotecky and Elena Pulvirenti.

         About joint work with Martin Tassy and/or Andrew Krieger. Previous works have shown that arctic circle phenomenons and limiting behaviors of some integrable discrete systems can be explained by a variational principle.
In this talk we present a method to deduce variational principles for non-integrable discrete systems. We illustrate the method by considering two different models. In the first model, we consider graph homomorphisms from $Z^d$ to a regular tree. In the second model, we derive a quenched variational principle for height functions exposed to a random field.

         The random conductance model is a well-established model for a random walk in random environment. In recent years the behaviour of the associated heat kernel and Green function has been intensively studied, and in dimension $d\geq 3$ the asymptotics of the Green kernel are meanwhile quite well-understood. In this talk we present precise asymptotics of the potential kernel and the Green function of the walk killed upon exiting balls in dimension $d=2$. This result holds, for instance, in the case of strictly elliptic conductances, random walks on supercritical percolation clusters or ergodic degenerate conductances satisfying a moment condition.

         Newly emerging imaging methods lead to the inverse problem of determining one or several coefficient function(s) in an elliptic partial differential equation from (partial) knowledge of its solutions. A natural and generic approach is to approximate the unknown coefficients by minimizing a linearized and regularized data-fit functional. In this talk, we will show how to regularize the linearized data-fit functional with monotonicity-based constraints in such a way that convergence of certain shape properties in the reconstructions can be rigorously guaranteed.

         In this contribution, we consider Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC)-type algorithm for a non-iterative microwave imaging of small anomalies located in a homogeneous media from scattering matrix without diagonal elements. In order to explain the feasibility of MUSIC in microwave imaging, we investigate mathematical structure of MUSIC by establishing a relationship with an infinite series of Bessel function of integer order and antennas setting. This is based on the representation formula of scattering parameters in the presence of small anomalies and the application of Born approximation. Simulation results using real-data at $f=~$925MHz frequency are exhibited to show the feasibility of designed algorithm and to support investigated structure of imaging function.

         The numerical solution of parameter identification problems in a partial differential equation (PDE) setting from (noisy) measurements usually requires numerous amounts of forward solutions of the respective PDE. One way to speed up the solution process therefore is to reduce the computational time of the forward solution, e.g. via the reduced basis method.

The reduced basis method is a model order reduction technique which constructs a low-dimensional subspace of the solution space. Galerkin projection onto that space allows for an approximative solution. An efficient offline/online decomposition enables the rapid computation of the approximative solution for many different parameters.

This talk will focus on the problem of magnet resonance electrical impedance tomography (MREIT), where the main objective is the acceleration of the well-known Harmonic $B_z$ Algorithm [1] using the adaptive reduced basis framework developed in [2]. The general idea of the framework is to adaptively construct a small, problem-oriented reduced basis space instead of constructing a global reduced basis space like it is usually the case in reduced basis methods. This will be done in an iterative procedure: the Harmonic $B_z$ Algorithm is projected onto the current reduced basis space and iterated until certain termination criteria are reached. The resulting parameter then is utilized to enrich the reduced basis space and therefore fit it to the given problem. This process is repeated until an iterate is accepted as the solution of the inverse problem. Numerical results will demonstrate the usefulness of the approach.

         Recently, deep learning techniques show significant performance over existing methods for medical imaging modalities including X-ray computed tomography (CT). In this talk, I will introduce how deep learning is utilized to reduce metal artifacts in X-ray CT imaging. Taking account of the fundamental difficulty in obtaining sufficient training data in a medical environment, the proposed learning method is designed to use simulated training data and a patient-type specific learning model is used to simplify the learning process. I will show the feasibility of the proposed method using numerical simulations and phantom experiment.

         This talk is concerned with parameter identification problems where a distributed parameter
is known a priori to only take on values from a given discrete set. This property can be
promoted in Tikhonov regularization with the aid of a suitable convex but nondifferentiable
regularization term. This allows applying standard approaches to show well-posedness and
convergence rates in Bregman distance. Using the specific properties of the regularization
term, it can be shown that convergence (albeit without rates) actually holds pointwise.
Furthermore, the resulting Tikhonov functional can be minimized efficiently using a
semi-smooth Newton method. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the regularization
term and the numerical solution. We also address the combination with total variation regularization.

         In this talk, we introduce a novel model for the restoration of a color image from a grayscale image with color data given only in small regions. The model is based on the idea of the generalization of the low dimensional manifold model and the YCbCr color space. It involves two prior terms, a weighted nonlocal Laplacian (WNLL) and a weighted total variation (WTV). The WNLL allows regions without color information to be interpolated smoothly from given sparse color data, while the WTV assists to inhibit the diffusion of color values across edges. To handle various types of sampled data, we introduce an updating rule for the weight function in the WNLL. Besides, we present an efficient iterative algorithm for solving the proposed model, and we show numerical results to validate the superior performance of the proposed model over that of the other state-of-the-art models.

         Imaging modalities represent a well-known application of the theory of inverse problems. In this context, it is typically assumed that the sought-for functions are independent of time. However, this assumption is often violated, e.g. in medical applications due to patient movements. In this case, standard reconstruction techniques lead to motion artefacts in the computed images. To compensate for the motion implies to include the time-dependency by suitable modelling and specially designed reconstruction algorithms. For example dynamic photoacoustic tomography and dynamic computerized tomography can be modeled by incorporating a displacement model in the static forward operator. If the Fourier integral structure of the operator is preserved, methods from microlocal analysis can provide insights on the design of the reconstruction algorithms. In this talk, we present an effective method to extract features of an object from motion-corrupted data with significantly reduced motion artefacts.

         This talk presents new approach for solving ill-posed nonlinear inverse problems. For ease of explanation of the proposed approach, we use the example of lung electrical impedance tomography (EIT), which is known to be a nonlinear and ill-posed inverse problem. Conventionally, penalty-based regularization methods have been used to deal with the ill-posed problem. However, experiences over the last three decades have shown methodological limitations in utilizing prior knowledge about tracking expected imaging features for medial diagnosis. The proposed method's paradigm is a completely different from the conventional approaches; the proposed reconstruction uses a variety of training data sets to generate a low dimensional manifold of approximate solutions, which allows to convert the ill-posed problem to a well-posed one. Variational autoencoder was used to produce a compact and dense representation for lung EIT images with a low dimensional latent space. Then, we learn a robust connection between the EIT data and the low-dimensional latent data. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed approach.

         Universality is one of the most important topics in the theory of quadratic forms.
For example, the famous Lagrange's four square theorem says that every positive rational integer is represented by the sum of four squares.
In 1996, all positive definite ternary universal quadratic forms over real quadratic number fields were found by W. K. Chan, M.-H. Kim and S. Raghavan.
In 2000, B. M. Kim proved that there are infinitely many real quadratic number fields which admit positive definite octonary universal quadratic forms.
But it is unknown whether 8 is the minimal rank with this property.
In this talk, we will prove that there exist only finitely many real quadratic number fields which admit a positive definite septenary universal quadratic forms.
This implies that 8 is indeed the minimal rank with the property.
This is a joint work with B. M. Kim and M.-H. Kim.

In particular, we compute the probability of the set of primes dividing the parametrization, which shows that a given prime $p&gt;2n$ close to $2n$ where $n$ is related with the degree of the parametrization appears as a factor very often.

         An Enriques surface is a non rational surface which occupies a block of the classification table of algebraic surfaces. F. Enriques (1907) showed that a generic Enriques surface has an infinite, non-cyclic, discontinuous group of automorphisms, and presented a question about the existence of an Enriques surface with only finitely many automorphisms. In 1911, G. Fano gave an example of Enriques surfaces with finite automorphism group. Later, by using the Torelli type theorem for K3 surfaces, V. Nikulin and S. Kondo classified all complex Enriques surfaces　with finite automorphism group (1984, 1986). Here we remark that any complex Enriques surface is the quotient of a K3 surface by a fixed point free involution. Recently the classification of all Enriques surfaces with finite automorphism group in any characteristics has been obtained by T. Katsura, S. Kondo and G. Martin. In this talk I will discuss the problem and a key idea of our approach.

         Questions concerning mutually orthogonal Latin squares and finite projective planes have previously been addressed by various combinatorial methods. We now propose a study of these questions by geometric methods, based on an analysis of the polytope of tristochastic tensors, and the real projective space of lines around the barycenter of the polytope. Using homogeneous coordinates in this projective geometry, orthogonality of Latin squares and quasigroups reduces to the usual concept of orthogonality of vectors. Points in the projective geometry corresponding to exact Latin squares are identified in the geometry by a partition condition.

         The study of prime rings and prime ideals has been an important topic in Ring Theory
because these notions help provide the description of structures of rings and modules related
to them. A ring $R$ is said to be \emph{prime} if every nonzero left ideal is faithful as a left $R$-module. In 2005, Haghany and Vedadi defined the notion of an endoprime module which generalizes the notion of a prime ring to a general module theoretic setting. Recall that a module $M$ is said to be \emph{endoprime} if any nonzero fully invariant submodule of $M$ is faithful as a left module over $S=\text{End}_R(M)$. Equivalently, $\mathbf{l}_S(N)=0$ for all $0 \neq N \unlhd M$.

In this talk, we further study endoprime modules and present a complete characterization of when an arbitrary direct sum of endoprime modules is also endoprime although even finite direct
sums of endoprime modules do not inherit the property.
Also, we fully characterize an endoprime module in terms of its endomorphism ring. The endoprime property is useful in view of its role in the Morita contexts which arise from an endoprime module.
Applications of our results and examples illustrating and delimiting the
results are provided.

         An early concept of matrix factorizations can be found in physics, especially by Dirac on the study of Heisenberg matrix mechanics. Eisenbud introduced this notion in mathematics to study homological algebra over hypersurface rings. Recently, matrix factorizations are getting more significant due to their various applications in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry, and mathematical physics. When a matrix factorization is induced by a linear matrix, it gives a presentation of an Ulrich sheaf which appears naturally in a number of important questions. Nevertheless, very few is known about Ulrich sheaves. In particular, the smallest possible rank of an Ulrich sheaf on a general cubic fourfold is unknown. Manivel recently shows that there are rank 9 Ulrich sheaves on a general cubic sevenfold using the invariant theory for the Lie group $E_6$. In this talk, I will give an alternative proof using Shamash's construction with the spinor variety. In particular, this provides the explicit description of a certain matrix factorization of the Cartan cubic. I will also give the complete classification of cubic forms whose Hessian induce matrix factorization of themselves via XJC-correspondence of Pirio and Russo.

         Let $R$ be an integral domain with quotient field $K$. We define a nonzero ideal $A$ of $R$ to be a $w$-SFT-ideal if there exist a finitely generated ideal $B \subseteq A$ and a positive integer $k$ such that $a^k \in B_w$ for each $a \in A_w$. The ring $R$ is said to be a $w$-SFT-ring if each nonzero ideal of $R$ is a $w$-SFT-ideal. Note that an ideal $A$ of $R$ is a $w$-SFT ideal if and only if $A_w$ is a $w$-SFT-ideal.
In this talk, we study the basic properties of $w$-SFT-rings.
We show that an integral domain $R$ is a Krull domain if and only if $R$ is a completely integrally closed $w$-SFT-ring.

         We investigate Beurling-Fourier algebras, a weighted version of Fourier algebras, on various Lie groups focusing on their spectral analysis. We will introduce a refined general definition of weights on the dual of locally compact groups and their associated Beurling-Fourier algebras. Constructions of nontrivial weights will be presented focusing on the cases of representative examples of Lie groups, namely $SU(n)$, the Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}$, the reduced Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}_r$, the Euclidean motion group $E(2)$ and its simply connected cover $\widetilde{E}(2)$. We will determine the spectrum of Beurling-Fourier algebras on each of the aforementioned groups emphasizing its connection to the complexification of underlying Lie groups. We also demonstrate ``polynomially growing&quot; weights does not change the spectrum and show the associated regularity of the resulting Beurling-Fourier algebras.

         The uncertainty principle implies that both a non-zero function $f$ and its Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ cannot be sharply localized. In other words, if a function $f$ is concentrated, then its Fourier transform $\widehat{f}$ should be dispersed. This principle has been explored within the framework of locally compact quantum groups in recent years. In this talk, we demonstrate that entropic uncertainty relations can be strengthened under localizations on discrete quantum groups.

We see its background, meanings in various areas, and several properties. Furthermore, we investigate the least squares mean with respect to the Wasserstein metric, called the Wasserstein mean, and explore some properties such as the determinantal inequality and bounds with respect to the operator norm and Loewner order. Finally we suggest its generalization to two points of view, the parameterized metric with sandwiched quasi-relative entropy and positive invertible operators.

         An invariant Gibbs measure is a special equilibrium state and is used in many fields of mathematics including thermodynamic formalism of topological dynamics.
\par
It is well known that if $X$ is a mixing shift of finite type and $f$ is a H\&quot;{o}lder continuous function from $X$ to $\mathbb{R}$, then there exists a unique invariant Gibbs measure with respect to the potential $f$ which is Bernoulli. Bowen proved that if $X$ is a subshift with the specification property and $f$ is a function in the Bowen class, then there exists a unique equilibrium state for $f$ which is a Gibbs measure for $f$. These results do not give much information outside specification. Baker and Ghenciu studied the existence of Gibbs measures for the potential $0$ in general shift spaces. They showed that there exists a Gibbs measure for the potential $0$ if and only if $X$ is (right-)balanced. Since the constructed measure need not be invariant in general and one working on dynamics and ergodic theory is usually interested in invariant measures, we study a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of invariant Gibbs measures for the potential $0$ and generalize this result for real-valued continuous functions of $X$.
\par
Let $X$ be a subshift and let $f$ be a real-valued continuous function of $X$. We say that $X$ is right-balanced with respect to $f$ if there exists $c&gt;0$ such that for $\forall u\in\mathcal{B}(X), \forall x_{uv}\in[uv], \forall x_u\in[u],$ and $\forall x_w\in[w]$,
$$c^{-1}\le\frac{\sum_{\substack{v\in\mathcal{B}_n(X)\\uv\in\mathcal{B}(X)}}{\exp(S_{\vert u\vert+n}f(x_{uv}))}}{\exp(S_{\vert u\vert}f(x_u))\sum_{w\in\mathcal{B}_n(X)}{\exp(S_nf(x_w))}}\le c,$$
where $m=\vert u\vert$. Similarly, we can define left-balancedness w.r.t. $f$. Using balancedness, we show that a subshift $X$ has an invariant Gibbs measure for the potential $f$ if and only if $X$ is right and left-balanced w.r.t. $f$ and that a subshift $X$ with the specification property has an invariant Gibbs measure for the potential $f$ if and only if $f$ is in the Bowen class.

         In this talk, we give recent results on the self-dual O(3) Maxwell-Chern-Simons-Higgs equations arising from planar condensed matter physics. The equations are divided into two categories: model for asymmetric vacua and model for symmetric vacua. From the physical motivation, we consider the equations on the whole two dimensional plane or the flat torus. We review recent progress on the existence and asymptotics of solutions for both cases, and give the main results on the existence of solutions on a tours for the symmetric vacua case.

An existence of solutions with a spike layer near critical points of the mean curvature on
the boundary $\partial \Omega$ is well known when a nondegeneracy for a limiting problem holds. We construct such solutions by a variational method which does not depend on the nondengeneracy for the limiting problem. By the variational approach, we construct the solutions for an optimal class of nonlinearities f satisfying the Berestycki-Lions conditions.

         Turing patterns on unbounded domains have been widely studied in systems of reaction-diffusion equations. However, up to now, they have not been studied for viscous systems of conservation laws. Here, we derive conditions for Turing instability in viscous systems of conservation laws and use these conditions to find families of periodic solutions bifurcating from uniform states, numerically continuing these families into the large-amplitude regime.

         We present asymptotic behavior and stability problem for the Schr\&quot;{o}dinger-Lohe(S-L) system which was first introduced as a possible phenomenological model exhibiting quantum synchronization. We present several sufficient frameworks leading to the emergent behaviors of the S-L system. To be more precise, we basically consider three types of network structures which describe the way how oscillators communicate with each others. In the presence of the network structures, we can expect interesting dynamical patterns other than synchronization, such as closed orbits and bi-polar states. In particular, under the all-to-all network, we show that there are only two possible asymptotic states: completely synchronized state or bi-polar state. Moreover, we claim that complete synchronization can happen for generic initial data showing that bi-polar state is unstable.

         We consider the Dirichlet problems for second-order linear elliptic equations
$$-\triangle u+\mathrm{div}\left(u\mathbf{b}\right)=f,\quad-\triangle v-\mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla v=g $$ in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}$, $n\ge3$, where $\mathbf{b}:\Omega\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is given. Under the assumption $\mathbf{b}\in L^{n}(\Omega)^{n}$, we first establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions in $L_{\alpha}^{p}(\Omega)$. Here $L_{\alpha}^{p}(\Omega)$ denotes the Sobolev spaces with the pair $(\alpha,p)$ satisfying certain conditions. Based on this result, we study the unique solvability of Dirichlet problem when the boundary data is in $L^2(\partial\Omega)$.

         We will revisit the structure of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) flows, especially KdV hierarchy, whose spectra are invariant, when the time passes. This isospectral flows are related to the existence of solitary waves like Tsunami. Except a traveling wave which is the simplest example, KdV equation is the most well studied one having such solutions. Since KdV equations are naturally generalized to canonical systems, we may expect that iso-spectral canonical systems would be found. In this talk, we will, however, show that it will be very difficult for such canonical flows like KdV ones to exist. To see this, due to the lack of existence on operators related to canonical systems, so called zero curvature equation will be applied, which is equivalent to the famous Lax pair formalism.

         In kinetic theory of many-body systems, it is well known that the mean-field kinetic equations can effectively describe the large ODE systems. In this talk, we introduce the swarming model on the unit sphere. We study the stability and instability of the incoherent state where all particles are uniformly distributed on the phase space. These phenomena depend on the interplay between the diffusion and coupling strength between the particles.

         We conduct a local sensivity analysis for the kinetic Kuramoto equation with random inputs in a large coupling regime. In our proposed random kinetic Kuramoto equation (in short, RKKE), the random inputs are encoded in the coupling strength. For the deterministic case, it is well known that the kinetic Kuramoto equation exhibits asymptotic phase concentration for well-prepared initial data in the large coupling regime. To see a response of the system to the random inputs, we provide propagation of regularity, local-in-time stability estimates for the variations of the random kinetic density function in random parameter space. For identical oscillators with the same natural frequencies, we introduce a Lyapunov functional measuring the phase concentration, and provide a local sensitivity analysis for the functional.

         In this talk, the operator norm on the weighted Lebesgue space $L^{2}(w)$ of some dyadic operators, such as dyadic paraproduct and commutator of the Hilbert transform with a vanishing mean oscillation function $b$, will be discussed.
It will be presented that the commutator of the Hilbert transform with a vanishing mean oscillation function $b$ depends linearly on the $A_2$-characteristic of the weight ($[w]_{A_2}$), as opposed to the quadratic dependence known to hold for the commutator of the Hilbert transform with BMO functions. The quadratic dependence of $[w]_{A_2}$ of the commutators with BMO functions is known to be sharp as well as the linear dependence of $[w]_{A_2}$ of the dyadic paraproduct. However, by choosing a function b in the space VMO, we can reduce the dependence to the linear which also known to hold for the Hilbert transform. Then the sharp extrapolation theorem return the following bound in $L^p(w)$, for $w\in A_p$:
$$\|[H,b]f\|_{L^p(w)}\leq C(p) [w]_{A_p}^{max\{1,1/(p-1)\}}\|f\|_{L^p(w)}\,.$$

         Let $(C[0,T],w_{\alpha,\beta})$ denote an analogue of a generalized Wiener space, the space of continuous real-valued functions on the interval $[0,T]$, where $\alpha,\beta:[0,T]\to\mathbb R$ are absolutely continuous functions such that $\beta$ is strictly increasing, and $\varphi$ is an arbitrary finite measure on the Borel class of $\mathbb R$. Define $X_n:C[0,T]\to\mathbb R^n$ by
$$X_n(x) = (\int_0^Te_1(s)dx(s),\ldots, \int_0^Te_n(s)dx(s)),$$ where $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n)\}$ is an orthonormal subset of $L_{\alpha,\beta}^2[0,T]$ which is an $L^2$-space with respect to the Lebesgue-Stieltjes measure induced by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
In this talk, we will derive a simple formula for integrals on $C[0,T]$ with the function $X_n$, which generalize the conditional Wiener integrals on $C[0,T]$. As applications of the simple formula, we will
evaluate the integrals of various function defined on $C[0,T]$.

         The coefficients of the asymptotic expansions of the heat trace of a Laplace operator on a compact Riemannian manifold are expressed by curvature tensors including scalar curvatures, Ricci tensor, and principal curvatures, etc. The gluing formula for the zeta-determinants of a Laplace operator was proved by Burghelea, Friedlander and Kappeler. This formula contains a defect constant, which is determined by some geometric data on a small collar neighborhood of a cutting hypersurface. In this talk, we show that this constant is expressed by some curvature tensors including scalar curvatures and principal curvatures of the cutting hypersurface in the ambient manifold, like the case of the heat trace asymptotics.

         The inverse mean curvature flow (IMCF) has been extensively studied not only as a type of geometric flows, but also for its applications to geometric inequalities. The focus is on Homothetic soliton as a special solution of IMCF, which is deformed only homothetically by the flow. We completely classify birotationally symmetric homothetic solitons that are $O(m)\times O(n)$-invariant hypersurfaces in $R^{m+n}$ using the phase-plane analysis, and analyze their asymptotic behavior at infinity using a suitable coordinate transformation. In particular, if $m \geq 2$ and $n = 1$, then the homothetic solitons have rotational symmetry.

Let $\theta$ be the Pfaffian system of the independent $1$-forms that annihilate $X$'s. The author presents in this talk a method of prolongation of the ideal ($h, \theta)$, to an involutive system, which proves the existence or non-existence of integral manifolds. The author will present hopefully some applications to affine dynamical control systems, where the map $h$ is the output function of the control system.

Vust proved that a normal $G$-variety together with an equivariant open embedding of a symmetric space, called a symmetric variety, is a spherical variety. From the Luna-Vust theory on spherical varieties, embeddings of spherical homogeneous spaces can be classified via colored fans. In 2011, Ruzzi classified smooth projective symmetric varieties with Picard number one by case-by-case study using colored fans. In particular, the such varieties whose restricted root systems are of type $A_2$ can be described as hyperplane sections of the Legendrian manifolds in the geometric Freudenthal-Tits magic square.
On the other hand, we say that a uniruled projective manifold has the Liouville property if every local vector field preserving the cone structure associated to the variety of minimal rational tangents (VMRT) can be extended to a global holomorphic vector field on a Zariski open subset. In this talk, we will discuss the Liouville property of a nonhomogeneous smooth projective symmetric variety with Picard number one by considering the automorphism group of this manifold, the Lie algebra of infinitesimal automorphisms of the affine cone of VMRT, and its prolongations.

         A graph is called intrinsically knotted if every embedding of the graph contains a knotted cycle. It is already known that intrinsically knotted graphs have at least 21 edges, and K7 and the 13 graphs
obtained from K7 by ∇-Y moves are the only intrinsically knotted graphs with 21 edges.
There are exactly two minor minimal bipartite intrinsically knotted graphs with 22 edges.
The goal of this talk is to show that there is no minor minimal bipartite intrinsically knotted graphs with 23 edges.

         A function from configuration space to moduli space of surface may induce a homomorphism between their fundamental groups which are braid groups and mapping class groups of surface, respectively. This map $\phi: B_k \rightarrow \Gamma_{g,b}$ is induced by 3-fold branched covering over a disk with some branch points. In this talk we give a description of this map and show that it is injective by Birman-Hilden theory. This gives us a new interesting non-geometric embedding of braid group into mapping class group. On the other hand, we show that the map on the level of classifying spaces of groups is compatible with the action of little 2-cube operad so that it induces a trivial homomorphism between stable homology group of braid groups and that of mapping class groups(Harer conjecture). We also show how the lift $\tilde{\beta_i}$ acts on the fundamental group of the surface and through this we prove that $\tilde{\beta_i}$ equals the product of two inverse Dehn twists.

         For each toric variety $X$, there is a canonical involution induced by a conjugation. The set of its fixed points, denoted by $X^{\mathbb R}$ is called a real toric variety. If $X$ is complete and non-singular, then $X$ and $X^{\mathbb R}$ are called a \emph{toric manifold} and a \emph{real toric manifold}, respectively.
The integral cohomology $H^\ast(X)$ of toric manifold $X$ is well-known. In particular, it has no torsion element. Nevertheless, only little is known about the integral cohomology of $X^{\mathbb R}$.
Recently, the speaker and his collaborators have developed the fundamental framework of real toric spaces.
In this talk, we discuss torsion elements in $H^\ast(X^{\mathbb R})$.
We show that any torsion can appear in $H^\ast(X^{\mathbb R})$. Furthermore, we find the necessary and sufficient condition for real toric manifolds to have a torsion-free cohomology group.

         Free actions of finite groups on the $3$-dimensional nilmanifold have been studied step by step by several researchers.
First, H. Chu and J. Shin showed that a finite group acting freely on the standard $3$-dimensional nilmanifold $\mathcal N_1$ with the first homology $\mathbb Z^2$ is cyclic ({\em Topology Appl.} {\bf 144} (2004), 255--270).
Next, free actions of finite abelian groups on the $3$-dimensional nilmanifold $\mathcal N_p$ with the first homology $\mathbb Z^2\oplus\mathbb Z_p$ were classified by D. Choi and J. Shin ({\em J. Korean Math. Soc.} {\bf 42(4)} (2005), 795--826).
In this article, we focus on the free actions of finite nonabelian groups on $\mathcal N_2$ and clarify what those groups are.
We study the such actions for $15$ cases of the $3$-dimensional almost Bieberbach groups, and
show that there exist three kinds of nonabelian free actions in $\pi_1$ or $\pi_4$, two in $\pi_2$ or $\pi_{5,i}(i=1,2,3)$, and one in the other cases.

         For a based CW-complex $X$, $\mathcal{A}_\sharp^n(X)$ is the submonoid of $[X,X]$
which consists of all homotopy classes of self maps of $X$ that induce an automorphism
on $\pi_k(X)$ for all $0\leq k \leq n$. Since, for $m&lt;n$, $\mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^ n(X)\subseteq \mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^m(X)$, there is a chain by inclusions: $\mathcal{E}(X)\subseteq\mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^{\infty}(X)\subseteq \cdots \subseteq \mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^1(X)\subseteq \mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^0(X)=[X,X].$
In this paper, we study the number of strict inclusions in this chain for given connected CW-complex. We call this number the self length of a given space. We prove that the number is a homotopy invariant and indicate a close connection with the self closeness number which is the minimum number $n$ such that $\mathcal{E}(X)=\mathcal{A}_{\sharp}^n(X)$. Moreover, we determine the self-lengths of several spaces and give the lower bounds or upper bounds of the self-lengths of some spaces.

         Given a topological space $X$ and a non-negative integer $k$,
$\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sharp}(X)$ is the set of all self-homotopy equivalences
of $X$ that do not change maps from $X$ to an $t$-sphere $S^{t}$
homotopically by the composition for all $t \geq k$. This set is a
subgroup of the self-homotopy equivalence group $\mathcal{E}(X)$. We find
certain homotopic tools for computations of $\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sharp}(X)$.
Using these results, we determine $\mathcal{E}_{k}^{\sharp}(M(G,n))$ for
$k\geq n$, where $M(G, n)$ is a Moore space type of $(G, n)$ for a
finitely generated abelian group $G$.

         P. Walters proved that an expansive homeomorphism $T:X\to X$ of a compact metric space $(X,d)$ with the pseudo orbit tracing property(POTP) is topologically stable. Then, R. F. Thomas obtained some versions of flows concerning the Walters' results and showed that the suspension flow $\varphi$ on $(Y,\rho)$ of a homeomorphism $T$ on $(X,d)$ under a continuous map $f: X \to \mathbb{R} &gt; 0$ has POTP if and only if $T$ has POTP.
In this talk we introduce some relations between the periodic shadowing property and POTP for continuous flows on a compact metric space and discuss the Thomas' results for flows via the notion of the periodic shadowing property.

         Given a factor map $\pi:X\to Y$ between topological dynamical systems $X$ and $Y$, Glasner and Weiss introduced the notion of relative Pinsker factor $Z$ in order to decompose the map $X\to Y$ into a completely positive entropy $X\to Z$ and zero entropy $Z\to Y$. Examples of relative Pinsker factors are well known when $Y$ is trivial. But when $Y$ is not trivial, no examples are known in the case of symbolic dynamical systems.

In this talk, we define a closely related notion of class decomposition of factor maps between symbolic dynamical systems, exploiting recent results from degree theory of symbolic dynamics. We show that class decomposition is almost an example of relative Pinsker factor.

         In this talk, we explain how dynamical systems with generating partitions are symbolically expansive namely symbolic counterparts of the expansive ones. Similar ideas allow the notions of symbolic equicontinuity, symbolic distality, symbolic N-expansivity and symbolic shadowing property. We analyze dynamical systems with these properties in the circle.

         Let $M$ be a compact $n(\geq2)$-dimensional manifold without boundary, and let
${\rm Diff}(M)$ be the space of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of $M$.
We show that if a diffeomorphism $f$ has the $C^1$ robustly weak shadowing property on a nontrivial transitive set $\Lambda\subset M$ then $\Lambda$ is hyperbolic for $f$.
We say that $f$ is {\it tame} if there is a $C^1$ neighborhood $\mathcal{U}(f)$ such that for any $g\in\mathcal{U}(f)$, $g$ has only finitely many chain recurrence class.
Gan suggested that if a diffeomorphism $f$ has the $C^1$ robustly weak shadowing property then is it tame? It is clear that if a diffeomorphism $f$ is Anosov then it is tame. The result is a partial answer of Gan's conjecture (see [1]).

         Canonical coordinates are very useful for ergodic theory, entropy calculations and topological dynamics. Since canonical coordinates move around with a point, we may extend certain notions which are valid for fixed or periodic points to this setting. Very recently, discrete dynamical systems with canonical coordinates are deal with robust dynamic property in [2] which has used R. Mane's result in [1]. In this talk, we discuss that a continuous dynamical system with canonical coordinates has periodic orbits shadowing every recurrent orbit.

         In this talk, we discuss transition densities of pure jump symmetric Markov processes whose jumping kernels are comparable to radially symmetric functions with general mixed polynomial growths. Under some mild assumptions on their scale functions, we establish sharp two-sided estimates of transition densities (heat kernel estimates) for such processes.

Under a suitable condition on the sparsity, we also prove that the rescaled, shifted extremal eigenvalue exhibit GOE Tracy-Widom law on the deterministic shift of the spectral edge.

         We examine a reinforcement model on the edges of a countably infinite network. The edge weights evolve according to a stochastic process subject to the following dynamics.

First, vertices fire at times given by a Poisson point process. Second, if a vertex fires at a point in time, then one of the incident edges is selected with a probability proportional to the current weight to a power $\alpha&gt;1$. Third, the weight of the selected edge is increased by 1.

We analyze the connectivity structure of the family of edges used a positive proportion of time.

         In the past decade, there have been many efforts to understand species interplay with biodiversity
in rock-paper-scissors (RPS) games within macro and microscopic levels. In this direction, mobility and intraspecific competition have been found to be the main factors promoting coexistence in spatially extended systems.
In this paper, we explore the relevant effect of asymmetric competitions coupled with mobility
on the coexistence of cyclically competing species. By examining the coexistence probability, we
have found that mobility can facilitate coexistence in the limited cases of asymmetric competition
and can be well predicted by the basin structure of the deterministic system. In addition, it is found
that mobility can have beneficial and harmful effects on coexistence when all competitions occur
asymmetrically. We also found that the coexistence in spatial dynamics of RPS game ultimately becomes a global attractor.

The lectures come with pre-coded python-based SageMath cells through which students can run and modify the code directly from this free laboratory. IDML is accessible via mobile devices so that the students can use it anywhere, anytime for maximum learning effectiveness and achievement. IDML would be an ideal tool for the effective learning and teaching of discrete mathematics, which combines theory and practice.

As a mathematician, I had finished program of doctoral degree in math education and have published articles in the area too. I have taught both courses in math and math education since 2006.
There has been noticeably different opinions between mathematician and math educators in teaching college math[ref. 'Math War']. The present period asks even math instructors to have concerns on pedagogics as well as mathematics knowledge. Through this talk I hope the audience open and share their experiences and knowledge in teaching college math.

         Differentiation is an important tool that helps to understand graphs of real-valued functions. Using the derivative of functions, we can draw graphs of real-valued functions on a Cartesian plane. On the other hand, it is difficult to figure out the shape of the graph of a complex-valued function using its derivatives. Nonetheless, the fact that a differentiable real-valued function has a property called local linearity, which means that the graph looks straight when you view it under a microscope, can be applied to any differentiable (analytic) complex-valued functions. Furthermore, since a linear complex-valued function expresses rotation, dilation, and translation, we can locally describe the derivative of a complex-valued function as the rotation and dilation of an image with respect to its pre-image. In this study, the researcher examined eight pre-service teachers' understanding about geometric interpretation of the derivative of complex-valued functions. As a result, they can develop their understanding using analogical reasoning from the property of real-valued functions with the aid of GeoGebra.

         Factor complexity (or subword complexity) of a word is a map assigning a positive integer $n$ to the number of distinct factors of length $n$ appearing in the word.
Factor complexity is a classical invariant which measures the disorder of words.
Kim and Lim generalized it to factor complexity of a vertex coloring of a regular tree.
It assigns $n$ to the number of distinct colorings on balls of radius $n$ which occurs in the coloring.

Sturmian words are infinite words with the minimal unbounded factor complexity $n+1$.
They are related to irrational rotations and cutting sequences on a square billiard.
Quasi-Sturmian words, which are words with factor complexity eventually $n+c$, share many properties with Sturmian words.

Kim and Lim defined the Sturmian colorings analogously.
They proved an induction algorithm for the Sturmian colorings.
In the same sense, we defined the quasi-Sturmian colorings.
In this talk, we will discuss induction algorithm for the quasi-Sturmian colorings.
Then, we will characterize the quasi-Sturmian colorings by their quotient graphs and recurrence functions.
This is joint work with Dong Han Kim, Seonhee Lim and Deokwon Sim.

         An $r$-dynamic $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper $k$-coloring $\phi$ such that for any vertex $v$, $v$ has at least $\min\{r,\deg_G(v) \}$ distinct colors in $N_G(v)$. The {\em $r$-dynamic chromatic number} $\chi_r^d(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the least $k$ such that there exists an $r$-dynamic $k$-coloring of $G$. The {\em list $r$-dynamic chromatic number} of a graph $G$ is denoted by $ch_r^d(G)$.

Loeb, Mahoney, Reiniger and Wise (2018) showed that if $G$ is a planar graph, then $\chi_3^d(G) \leq 10$, and there is a planar graph $G$ with $\chi_3^d(G) = 7$. Thus finding an optimal upper bound on $\chi_3^d(G)$ for a planar graph $G$ is a natural interesting problem. In this paper, we show that $\chi_r^d(G) \leq 5$ if $G$ is a planar triangulation. The upper bound is sharp.

         By complexity of a finite graph we mean the number of spanning trees in the graph. The aim of the present talk is to give a new approach for counting complexity of cyclic coverings of a graph.

         Singular overpartitions, which are defined by George Andrews, are overpartitions whose Frobenius symbols have at most one overlined entry in each row. In his paper, Andrews found interesting combinatorial and arithmetic properties of $(k,i)$-singular overpartitions, which are singular overpartitions with some restrictions subject to $k$ and $i$. In this talk, we present a combinatorial proof of a refinement of Andrews's result using the Dyson map and the Wright map.

         For a matroid $M$ on $[n]:= \{1, 2, \dots, n \}$, a matroid base polytope $\mathcal{P}(M)$ is the polytope in $\mathbb{R}^n$ whose vertices are the incidence vectors of the bases of $M$.
A lattice path matroid is a transversal matroid corresponding to a pair of lattice paths having common end points.
The combinatorial and structural properties of lattice path matroids are studied by Bonin et al.
In this talk, we study the facial structure of a matroid base polytope which corresponds a lattice path matroid

         In this talk, we will study clique adjacency polynomials. And we will use these polynomials to obtain a bound on cliques, we call this bound as the clique adjacency bound. We will compare this bound with the Hoffman bound for the class of edge-regular graphs.
