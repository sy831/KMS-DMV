          Aspects of Logic and Computing in Real Number Models
        </summary>
            <p>
              We present an extract of own work over the past years focussing on logical aspects in the study of real number computation
        and complexity as introduced by Blum, Shub, and Smale.
        After a brief introduction into the model we address the following
        topics: Structure inside the real number analogue of NP, degrees
        of undecidability, and descriptive complexity over the reals.

              First-order theory of Internally Categorical Second-order Arithmetic
            </summary>
              <p>
                Wilkieâ€™s theorem (1987) tells us that Peano arithmetic (PA) is the minimal first-order theory captured by the schematisation of the restricted second-order categorical axiomatisation of the standard model   <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{N} </script> over some finite first-order theory -- that is, the first-order schematisation Scheme(<script type="math/tex"> \Phi </script>) of the second order axiom   <script type="math/tex">\forall X\Phi(X)</script> is such that Scheme(  <script type="math/tex">\Phi)\vdash_{FOL}PA</script>. But it fails to provide us with a maximal first-order theory, which suggests that external categoricity of arithmetic is not enough to present us with the corresponding unique first-order theory. The situation is different when internal categoricity is involved -- we say that a second-order theory   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> is internally categorical if, in second-order logic with arithmetical language, it is deducible that all models of   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> are isomorphic to one another -- that is
                <script type="math/tex">\vdash_{SOL}(\forall M^2,N^2 \models T^2 (M^2 \cong N^2))</script>.
              We will prove that the first-order theory captured by an internally categorical theory is exactly the theorems of second-order PA in the first-order language of arithmetic.

                Mekler's construction on <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script> theory.
              </summary>
              <p>
                Mekler has developed a way of interpreting any structure as a pure group. These groups are nilpotent of class 2 and of exponent <script type="math/tex">p>2</script>. It is known that this construction preserves various model-theoretic properties, such as stability, simplicity, and <script type="math/tex">NTP_2</script> so that it gives us certain pure group examples. In this talk, I will introduce the Mekler construction, and briefly show the main result that this construction also preserves <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script>.

                 Geometric stability theory for <script type="math/tex">\mu</script>-structures
               </summary>
               <p>
                 We introduce a notion of <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures which are certain locally compact group actions and prove some counterparts of results on Polish structures introduced by Krupinski. Using the Haar measure of locally compact groups, we introduce an independence, called <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence, in <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures having good properties. With this independence notion, we develop geometric stability theory for <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures. Then we see some structural theorems for compact groups which are <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structure. We also give examples of profinite structures where <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence is different from <script type="math/tex">nm-</script>independence introduced by Krupinski for Polish structures.

                Model Checking on Sparse Graphs and Beyond
              </summary>
              <p>
                While model checking, i.e. the algorithmic problem of checking whether a given formula is true in a given finite structure, is
easily seen to be PSPACE complete in most interesting settings and remains hard when parameterized by the input formula,
efficient algorithms have been found for restricted classes of structures such as planar graphs. Since model checking provides a
unified approach to various algorithmic problems, such results are often referred to as algorithmic meta-theorems.
<br />
                We will review known algorithmic meta-theorems, which have focussed on /sparse/ structure, in a sense that has only recently
been made precise. We will then see why current techniques are unlikely to produce results for non-sparse structures and investigate possible techniques for breaking this barrier.

                First Order G&ouml;del Logics with Propositional Quantifiers
              </summary>
              <p>
                First order G&ouml;del logics form a well established class of many-valued logics with good proof-theoretic properties and extensive theory.<br />
<br />
Quantified Propositional G&ouml;del Logics have been studied only a few times, and not much is known about these logics besides a few results for specific logics. Propositional quantifiers allow for quantification of propositions, which in the setting of G&ouml;del logics boils down to quantification over all truth values of the underlying truth-value set. Thus, they are somewhere between first order and second order quantifiers.<br />
<br />
It has already been shown that there are uncountably many quantified propositional G&ouml;del logics (without first order quantifiers), which is in stark contrast to the fact that there are only countably many first order G&ouml;del logics.<br />
<br />
For three cases, namely <script type="math/tex">V_\infty=[0,1], V_\downarrow = \{0\}\cup\{1/n\mathrel{:} n\gt 0\}</script>,<br />
and <script type="math/tex">V_\uparrow = \{1\}\cup\{1-1/n\mathrel{:} n\gt0\}</script>, quantifier elimination has been shown for the propositional quantified G&ouml;del logics, in later two cases by extension of the language with an additional operator.<br />
<br />
In this talk we report on our research program to study the combination of propositional and first-order quantifieres with respect to G&ouml;del logics.
