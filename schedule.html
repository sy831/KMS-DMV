                Mekler's construction on <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script> theory.
              </summary>
              <p>
                Mekler has developed a way of interpreting any structure as a pure group. These groups are nilpotent of class 2 and of exponent <script type="math/tex">p>2</script>. It is known that this construction preserves various model-theoretic properties, such as stability, simplicity, and <script type="math/tex">NTP_2</script> so that it gives us certain pure group examples. In this talk, I will introduce the Mekler construction, and briefly show the main result that this construction also preserves <script type="math/tex">NTP_1</script>.

               <p>
                 We introduce a notion of <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures which are certain locally compact group actions and prove some counterparts of results on Polish structures introduced by Krupinski. Using the Haar measure of locally compact groups, we introduce an independence, called <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence, in <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures having good properties. With this independence notion, we develop geometric stability theory for <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structures. Then we see some structural theorems for compact groups which are <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>structure. We also give examples of profinite structures where <script type="math/tex">\mu-</script>independence is different from <script type="math/tex">nm-</script>independence introduced by Krupinski for Polish structures.

              First-order theory of Internally Categorical Second-order Arithmetic
            </summary>
              <p>
                Wilkie’s theorem (1987) tells us that Peano arithmetic (PA) is the minimal first-order theory captured by the schematisation of the restricted second-order categorical axiomatisation of the standard model   <script type="math/tex"> \mathbb{N} </script> over some finite first-order theory -- that is, the first-order schematisation Scheme(<script type="math/tex"> \Phi </script>) of the second order axiom   <script type="math/tex">\forall X\Phi(X)</script> is such that Scheme(  <script type="math/tex">\Phi)\vdash_{FOL}PA</script>. But it fails to provide us with a maximal first-order theory, which suggests that external categoricity of arithmetic is not enough to present us with the corresponding unique first-order theory. The situation is different when internal categoricity is involved -- we say that a second-order theory   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> is internally categorical if, in second-order logic with arithmetical language, it is deducible that all models of   <script type="math/tex">T^2</script> are isomorphic to one another -- that is
                <script type="math/tex">\vdash_{SOL}(\forall M^2,N^2 \models T^2 (M^2 \cong N^2))</script>.
              We will prove that the first-order theory captured by an internally categorical theory is exactly the theorems of second-order PA in the first-order language of arithmetic.

                Model Checking on Sparse Graphs and Beyond
              </summary>
              <p>
                While model checking, i.e. the algorithmic problem of checking whether a given formula is true in a given finite structure, is
easily seen to be PSPACE complete in most interesting settings and remains hard when parameterized by the input formula,
efficient algorithms have been found for restricted classes of structures such as planar graphs. Since model checking provides a
unified approach to various algorithmic problems, such results are often referred to as algorithmic meta-theorems.
<br />
                We will review known algorithmic meta-theorems, which have focussed on /sparse/ structure, in a sense that has only recently
been made precise. We will then see why current techniques are unlikely to produce results for non-sparse structures and investigate possible techniques for breaking this barrier.

          Aspects of Logic and Computing in Real Number Models

            <p>
              We present an extract of own work over the past years focussing on logical aspects in the study of real number computation
        and complexity as introduced by Blum, Shub, and Smale.
        After a brief introduction into the model we address the following
        topics: Structure inside the real number analogue of NP, degrees
        of undecidability, and descriptive complexity over the reals.

                A Possible Combination of Concepts from Set Theory and Leśniewski's Mereology for an Alternative to ZFC
              </summary>
              <p>
                It is well-known that ZFC has long been a firm foundation for modern mathematics. However, due to its limits such as the undecidability of the continuum hypothesis, several mathematicians and logicians have thought up possible supplementations for ZFC or have created alternative foundations (such as NBG, Leśniewski's mereology, etc.) to it. 
                In this talk I will present my trial of combining concepts from set theory, type theory, and Leśniewski's mereology to suggest a possible alternative to ZFC and show how mathematical concepts such as binary relations, functions,  <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{N}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}</script>, and  <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{C}</script> can be defined. 
                Although my trial contained contradictions and thus failed, I would like to emphasize that adding the concept of parthood from mereology could be a possible supplementation for current set theories.

                First Order G&ouml;del Logics with Propositional Quantifiers
              </summary>
              <p>
                First order G&ouml;del logics form a well established class of many-valued logics with good proof-theoretic properties and extensive theory.<br />
<br />
Quantified Propositional G&ouml;del Logics have been studied only a few times, and not much is known about these logics besides a few results for specific logics. Propositional quantifiers allow for quantification of propositions, which in the setting of G&ouml;del logics boils down to quantification over all truth values of the underlying truth-value set. Thus, they are somewhere between first order and second order quantifiers.<br />
<br />
It has already been shown that there are uncountably many quantified propositional G&ouml;del logics (without first order quantifiers), which is in stark contrast to the fact that there are only countably many first order G&ouml;del logics.<br />
<br />
For three cases, namely <script type="math/tex">V_\infty=[0,1], V_\downarrow = \{0\}\cup\{1/n\mathrel{:} n\gt 0\}</script>,<br />
and <script type="math/tex">V_\uparrow = \{1\}\cup\{1-1/n\mathrel{:} n\gt0\}</script>, quantifier elimination has been shown for the propositional quantified G&ouml;del logics, in later two cases by extension of the language with an additional operator.<br />
<br />
In this talk we report on our research program to study the combination of propositional and first-order quantifieres with respect to G&ouml;del logics.

                Logic for exact real arithmetic
              </summary>
              <p>
                Previous work with U. Berger, K. Miyamoto and H. Tsuiki is extended in two
  directions.  (1) Instead of viewing the real numbers as abstractly
  given objects with all the necessary properties assumed as axioms we
  now use concrete real numbers (Cauchy sequences with moduli) and
  provide formal proofs in the style of constructive analysis
  (Bishop 67).  Apart from being more complete, this resolves the
  delicate issue which equality (for reals) is to be used in the
  clauses of coinductively defined predicates.  However, the choice of
  our model for the reals does not influence the extracted (signed
  digit or Gray code based) algorithms, since quantifiers over real
  numbers are taken as non-computational.  (2) Using ideas from
  Ciaffaglione and Gianantonio, we extract signed digit and Gray
  code based algorithms for division from a proof that the reals are
  closed under division.

                Transforming the Weihrauch lattice into a Brouwer algebra 
              </summary>
              <p>
                We prove that the Weihrauch lattice can be transformed into a Brouwer algebra by the consecutive application of two closure operators in the appropriate order: first completion and then parallelization. The closure operator of completion is a new closure operator that we introduce. It transforms any problem into a total problem on the completion of the respective types, where we allow any value outside of the original domain of the problem. This closure operator is of interest by itself, as it generates a total version of Weihrauch reducibility that is defined like the usual version of Weihrauch reducibility, but in terms of total realizers. From a logical perspective completion can be seen as a way to make problems independent of their premises. Alongside with the completion operator and total Weihrauch reducibility we need to study precomplete representations hat are required to describe these concepts. In order to show that the parallelized completed Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra, we introduce a new multiplicative version of an implication.
While the parallelized completed Weihrauch lattice forms a Brouwer algebra with this implication,
the completed Weihrauch lattice fails to be a model of intuitionistic linear logic in two different ways. In order to pinpoint the algebraic reasons for this failure, we introduce the concept of a Weihrauch algebra that allows us to formulate the failure in precise and neat terms.

                Formal Methods in the Software Industry - A success story?
              </summary>
              <p>
              Formal Methods, the use of mathematical techniques for the specification, development and verification of software, have been explored by researchers since the 60ies, as a way to improve software quality. But their application in the software industry has been relatively rare. The reasons for this include perceived complexity of the tools and high cost of their use. In the last decade however, tools have become better, and the software challenges in the industry larger, so that the cost-benefit argument has changed. Large companies are applying formal methods every day to find bugs in their software, or even to prove the absence of bugs.
In this talk, we will give an overview over the history of formal methods in the software industry, the changes in the industry that motivate their increased use, and showcase the recent progress and applications of formal methods in the development of software.
